0	9000	like SSL that we're going to go over later and there's some wireless, I think it ends
9000	17000	with some firewalls which also will go in depth and wireless.
17000	23000	Any questions from us?
23000	32000	So again, I would like to have your new proposals by next Tuesday, like last time.
32000	40000	If you have any fundamental questions there about what I expect, ask.
40000	44000	I'll have officers on Monday.
44000	49000	Again, I want to deal with two people.
49000	59000	No double dipping means not to use material that you did already or you're doing in parallel
59000	61000	in some other course.
61000	67000	So there has to be something distinct that you do for this part.
67000	77000	And if you plan to do writing, survey or something like that, no chatbots.
77000	81000	That should be you.
81000	89000	If you do use some tools that you are not sure, or you want to use some tools, you're not quite sure if this transcends the boundary, just ask.
89000	95000	It's easier to ask now than to explain later.
95000	101000	Okay, so user authentication, one of the basic topics in computer security.
101000	103000	How do we authenticate humans?
103000	107000	That means us.
107000	112000	All right, basic problem.
112000	121000	Somebody claims to be Alice or Bob, and now how do you prove that you are that Alice or Bob?
121000	123000	Now why do we do authentication?
123000	126000	We do authentication in order to enforce access control.
126000	132000	All right, just authentication for the sake of authentication isn't useful.
132000	137000	What's the point of authenticating you if nothing happens?
137000	147000	And any form of, any time you are asked for anything that identifies you and authenticates you, it's for some purpose.
147000	152000	Whether it's a policeman that stops you and says, where's your driver's license?
152000	155000	The driver's license is to let you go.
155000	157000	If you authenticate you, you let you go.
157000	158000	Then you get a ticket.
158000	161000	And without the driver's license, you might get arrested.
161000	163000	So no access to driving privileges, right?
163000	171000	If you work for a company, you use a badge and maybe sometimes a camera to authenticate you as an employee, right?
171000	174000	So you can have access to the premises.
174000	180000	You get into the UCI's Google space, right?
180000	183000	Google Docs and Drive space.
183000	190000	You authenticate it via a dual and password username so you can get access to those resources, et cetera, et cetera.
190000	194000	So there's always a reason for why you are being authenticated, right?
194000	199000	There is something that you are given access to if you succeed in authentication.
199000	200000	Okay.
200000	205000	So this pops up just about everywhere.
205000	214000	So, of course, as you know, there are many ways to prove that you are.
214000	215000	Say you are.
215000	218000	The most familiar ones are passwords.
218000	228000	Their demise has been predicted for the last 40 years, and yet they are still here.
228000	233000	Moreover, they show no signs of going away anytime soon.
233000	236000	An interesting parallel, email.
236000	240000	Email has been around since early 80s.
240000	243000	Pretty much the same way it is used to be.
243000	248000	Maybe the WYSIWYG changed, you know, the here and there, but the interfaces, et cetera.
248000	250000	But email is pretty much the same.
250000	254000	Same format email addresses, and every year somebody says, yeah, I guarantee it.
254000	255000	You know, it's like a doomsday.
255000	258000	You say, oh, yeah, the end of the world is coming tomorrow.
258000	259000	Just you wait.
259000	261000	And tomorrow comes, ah, you know what?
261000	262000	My clock was wrong.
262000	263000	I was like, yeah, it missed you.
263000	266000	Anyway, ah, the stars did not align.
266000	270000	So the same thing about email and password, doomsday predictions.
270000	271000	Email is still here.
271000	272000	Password is still here.
272000	274000	No signing going on.
274000	275000	Right.
275000	282000	So passwords we know, and nobody loves them, but we're used to them.
282000	285000	And then we have passphrases, right?
285000	290000	Or answers to personal questions.
290000	295000	Like, what color eyes do you like the most?
295000	300000	Or, what was the make of your first automobile?
300000	303000	Really difficult questions, right?
303000	306000	And then there are, of course, secret keys, right?
306000	307000	So we can use some secret keys.
307000	310000	If you can remember them, you can use them, right?
310000	315000	Or you can write them down, which will be a lot of fun.
315000	319000	But these are things you know, presumably.
319000	321000	Pins are, of course, another form.
321000	324000	It's a variation of the theme of passwords, right?
324000	328000	Because they're supposed to be numbers, not alphanumeric characters.
328000	332000	Then you can do authentication based on where you are.
332000	339000	So that is, if you are in some space, and you can prove you are in some space, geographical
339000	344000	location, then you must have access to something.
344000	346000	You might be giving access to something.
346000	350000	Like, if you are in some secure room in the Pentagon, by virtue of being in that secure
350000	355000	room, you're allowed to access some computer system or some database.
355000	360000	I'm not saying that's how it should be, but it can be like that.
360000	366000	It could also be an IP address given to you by your internet provider.
366000	375000	So, for example, if you live in the campus housing, your entry is provided by UCI, right?
375000	382000	As opposed to, say, me, I also live on campus, Canada campus, I think on Union Hills here,
382000	386000	next to campus, my address is provided by Cox.
386000	391000	And all my neighbors are in the cost of Google to buy them.
391000	395000	So the IP address tells you something.
395000	398000	If you believe me, the IP address, of course.
398000	400000	It could be home phone, right?
400000	403000	Of course, people don't use home phones anymore, right?
403000	405000	Landlines are rare.
405000	406000	Cell phone.
406000	411000	Cell phone used to be able to, many, many, many years ago, if you had a certain cell phone number,
411000	415000	then you had to be in a particular space, because back then there was no roaming, right?
415000	419000	So if your phone number worked, that means you were, you know, with a 949 area code,
419000	420000	you were in North County.
420000	422000	It doesn't work anymore.
422000	430000	Now, MAC addresses, could they be used for identifying where you are, right?
430000	433000	Or for anything at all?
433000	438000	Everybody knows what MAC addresses is, right?
438000	447000	Theoretically, MAC addresses supposed to tell you something about the interface of the device.
447000	448000	Any ideas?
448000	449000	No?
449000	451000	Too early?
451000	454000	MAC addresses have a special format.
454000	459000	They actually should tell you who the manufacturer of the device, or the interface.
459000	464000	It doesn't tell you necessarily where you are, and that's why I put a question mark there.
464000	466000	Also, MAC addresses are impermanent.
466000	470000	There was a time when most devices that have MAC addresses, you couldn't change them.
470000	482000	Today, you can change MAC addresses on most laptops, industrial or desktop systems, most laptops, cell phones, and other guys.
482000	488000	Also, even if MAC addresses were impermanent, MAC addresses are only used for the one hub, right?
488000	491000	That's a data link layer.
491000	496000	So, in this room, the MAC address is only visible to the access point.
496000	498000	But beyond the access point, it has no meaning, right?
498000	499000	There's nothing.
499000	501000	It doesn't longer go there.
501000	506000	Okay, then there's what you are as a human, right?
506000	513000	Now, what you are are your intrinsic features, like your DNA, right?
513000	524000	Your fingerprints, your eyes, your face geometry, your hand geometry, your vein pattern on your wrist.
524000	531000	There's gait, where you are, not a very good biometric, but that's in you.
531000	533000	All kinds of other things.
533000	538000	And then there is the one that you are familiar with the most, which is what you have, right?
538000	543000	It's a possession of something.
543000	544000	We know this, right?
544000	547000	This is the most frequent two-factor.
547000	552000	You have the app on your phone, and it's visually secure.
552000	553000	You trust the app.
553000	556000	The app will pop up, right?
556000	562000	Either with the approve, disapprove, or a code, right?
562000	567000	The temporary code, that essentially, by entering that code or hitting approve,
567000	570000	you're saying, I'm in possession of this phone.
570000	574000	And because this phone has been pre-registered as associated with you,
574000	577000	there's a reasonable assumption that because you have this phone,
577000	581000	and previously you entered the right password and username,
581000	586000	must be the case that you are a police agent.
586000	588000	And if you think of it, any other?
588000	590000	Might I miss something?
590000	595000	Any other basis upon which you can be authenticated?
595000	602000	What you know, where you are, what you are, what you have.
602000	608000	Some people suggested where you've been, but that's hard to remember.
608000	611000	So, how do our passwords work?
611000	612000	No.
612000	613000	Quiet track.
613000	614000	No.
614000	615000	Yeah.
615000	616000	Without a sign.
616000	618000	So, must not be able to remember.
618000	619000	Right.
619000	620000	So, you have a secret password.
620000	625000	You pick the secret password, and the system checks to authenticate that password.
625000	632000	Now, sometimes, of course, you don't pick the secret password,
632000	634000	sometimes the secret password is given to you.
634000	638000	Like, how many of you have used a browser to select a secret password?
638000	640000	Then you don't actually know anything.
640000	641000	Right?
641000	642000	All you do is, what?
642000	651000	You log into your computer, or your, uh, smartphone computer, like that.
651000	658000	And, the idea is that the browser, especially something like Chrome, let's say.
658000	665000	I want to pick, I use Firefox sometimes here, but let's say Chrome, which is popular.
665000	668000	Um, you also have to log into your profile, right?
668000	669000	On Chrome.
669000	674000	So, you log into the computer, you log into the browser, but the browser doesn't know what
674000	675000	you log into the computer.
675000	681000	So, in fact, you log into your profile on Chrome, and that essentially unlocks the so-called
681000	690000	password vault, or password bundle, that is stored in your profile on Chrome.
690000	692000	Not super reassuring, right?
692000	697000	But, convenient, because as long as you use that Chrome, right?
697000	699000	Actually, it doesn't have to be Chrome there, right?
699000	701000	You could be using Chrome somewhere else.
701000	707000	You know, if you set it up correctly, that password that Chrome picked for you will be available
707000	710000	once you authenticate with the right folder.
710000	711000	Right.
711000	717000	So, initialization, but typically the password initialization is you pick the password based
717000	720000	on some password rules.
720000	725000	Which vary, of course, from site to site, from time to time.
725000	730000	And, um, how do you actually communicate with the log in time for the first time, right?
730000	733000	Or for subsequent times, right?
733000	736000	There is always this risk of eavesdropping.
736000	737000	Right?
737000	746000	So, if you imagine the most naive way of communicating a password is you type your password and then
746000	748000	it just goes somewhere.
748000	753000	Now, if it's a local computer, maybe you can have a little more trust.
753000	758000	You trust the operating system that the log in prompt is actually from the operating system.
758000	759000	Right?
759000	765000	So, when you turn on your laptop, you have tablets and laptops, and when you open it, so turn
765000	771000	it on, and the log in prompt occurs, and says, usually it doesn't say username, right?
771000	772000	You can't, right?
772000	773000	But usually it just ends your password.
773000	774000	Do you know who's asking you for a password?
774000	775000	Who's still a computer?
775000	776000	Do you know who's asking?
776000	777000	Should be the operating system.
777000	778000	Should be the operating system.
778000	779000	Is it the operating system?
779000	780000	Do you have any way to verify that, in fact, the window that shows you the login is the operating
780000	781000	system window?
781000	782000	I say no.
782000	783000	I don't think you know.
783000	809000	Maybe if you have an encrypted disk, would you type in your password and connect it for
809000	820380	But even then, I mean, if it just scrolls the right things, it says bias, blah blah blah blah, authenticating, initializing, enterprise, you don't know.
821020	831820	So, I'm not trying to cause panic here, but you should be aware that, so you have a little more sure when your computer is doing a cold boot, right?
831820	835540	Because it's functionally like turned off, although that's a whole other story.
836400	838180	How do you know your device is turned off?
839000	841360	We will touch upon this in a couple of days.
841360	850120	You often tell it to turn off, you press the button, and how do you know it's off?
850120	853560	Well, you say, well, you know what, I'll just unplug it from the wall.
854560	855900	Are you sure that's on?
856740	857980	Are you sure there's no battery?
859400	860980	Do you know what's inside the device?
862340	864240	They have CMOS battery, too.
864240	871160	Ah, yeah, but you should like disassembling the device, voiding the warranty, and causing electric shock, potentially.
871680	873160	So, actually, you don't.
873220	874640	So, that's a depressing thought, right?
874680	877420	You actually don't know who is asking for the password.
877900	878720	But we trust.
878720	882180	Okay, but that's the password that goes to your operating system, right?
883320	885420	It doesn't go on the wire, right?
885520	886620	It's not sent anywhere.
886620	896240	What about if you're logging into Facebook, or, you know, your Instagram, or whatever, your favorite website, or any kind of service?
896500	897820	Like, you're going into UCI.
898440	904800	A window pops up that looks like UCI's little pop-up, with blue and stuff, you know, all the right colors.
904940	906600	How busy is this to copy?
906600	909680	So, you enter your password, and then it goes.
910000	910700	So, you don't know.
911700	917480	But let's suspend our disbelief, and say, okay, we trust that it goes, it goes to the right place, okay, okay, okay.
918620	920200	But what about how is it sent?
921100	922680	Is it sent in clear text?
924760	925620	That's bad, right?
925700	928280	It can't be sent in clear text, because then it gets used to the other part.
929880	933500	Okay, well, you hope that actually in reality, it sends over a secure connection.
933500	945100	And sort of prior to you entering the password, whatever the stub application, whether it's a browser, a client browser, or some other application on your laptop, or your phone,
945420	952080	has already established a secure, usually TLS, or VPN connection, to the other end.
955440	958700	But even then, you might not trust that connection.
958700	965820	So, probably not a good idea to send the password unencrypted, even over the connection.
965960	969420	So, what's typically done is the password is, like, hashed.
970160	971220	Remember hash functions, right?
973120	973520	Yeah.
974040	975600	Now the question is, where is it hashed?
976700	978800	So, who gets to see your password locally?
979360	982400	Maybe it's hashed in software, with a client software.
982400	986300	Maybe it's hashed in hardware.
986980	990960	Maybe there's a way for the login prompt, or if it presents you with a password prompt,
991200	994780	to communicate directly to some hardware inside your laptop of a smartphone,
995280	998280	that actually takes that password, hashes it, and that's it.
999760	1003700	And then there's a template resistant, because if it's not, maybe, you know, somebody can hack it.
1003700	1008280	And then, how does the other end check the password?
1009200	1013540	Well, and of course, is your password guessable?
1014180	1014380	Right?
1014920	1018420	None of this other stuff is important if your password is weak.
1020260	1020520	Right?
1020540	1023220	If I can, with reasonable probability, guess your password,
1023480	1029740	all the other measures to prevent theft and misuse of password, they're useless.
1029740	1035320	Because guessing a password means somebody is going to try to log in, just like you would.
1036560	1040980	So, whatever measures are taken after you enter a password and hit return,
1041100	1043100	they're useless if the password is being guessed.
1046760	1050280	Also, on most operating systems, it's difficult to keep a password file secret.
1052360	1053920	Especially like multi-user systems.
1055240	1059180	So, I know that you are all used to, essentially, single-user computers, right?
1059740	1064160	I mean, how many people usually have, like, multiple profiles on their Android?
1064600	1066980	I mean, you can do it, but it's a pain.
1067920	1070340	How many of you share your laptop with others?
1071160	1073320	My guess is not many, if any.
1074640	1078700	Maybe when you were younger, and you had, like, a sibling, and you shared your laptop.
1080560	1083700	Or the parent will let you use their laptop and create an account.
1083840	1086460	But most people, like, you're 80, they don't share laptops.
1086460	1091600	So, this does not seem relevant to you, but think about a bigger world out there.
1093020	1094180	Like, an organization.
1095800	1099100	Where you have multiple users, multiple, many users,
1099680	1102460	and they all need to log in and access the same system.
1102460	1109540	So, you need to store the password database somewhere, the password file, right?
1110540	1115100	And so, in modern systems, at least one of the Unix derived,
1115520	1117980	historically, the password file is accessible.
1119440	1120960	It's called world-readable.
1122360	1126920	And the reason it's world-readable is because it's not just the password file.
1127160	1128820	It's, essentially, the user database.
1128820	1135840	And so, programs that run on Linux, or Unix, and whatever,
1136060	1138700	all these Unix-derived operating systems,
1139040	1141940	they need to consult that file, not for the password's sake,
1142680	1148360	but for account's sake, to figure out what accounts have rights for what resources.
1149380	1150900	So, it's mostly for access control.
1151740	1151920	Okay?
1152520	1156680	This was done a long time ago, when Unix first was born, in the 80s.
1156680	1161020	Now, with hard-to-remember passwords,
1162600	1165700	if you don't pick a weak password, you pick a hard-to-remember password, you're good.
1166120	1169480	And if your memory is good, wonderful.
1170620	1173360	But what about reusing passwords?
1174940	1177640	A lot of people can remember one difficult password.
1178780	1179060	Right?
1179060	1181500	I'm sure you can remember one difficult password.
1182360	1184680	That is not, by any standard, weak.
1186360	1189260	But then, can you remember 10, 15?
1189780	1192800	These days, most of us have well over 10,
1192960	1195980	some of us, I would say, around 20 different accounts.
1196120	1199040	There have been some studies about this, but I don't think it's an immediate number.
1199040	1206880	You could carry around an object, like some kind of a device, like a smartphone,
1207120	1211520	maybe, that has your passwords all stored there in plain text.
1212140	1214940	And you unlock your phone, you access your password, and you're like, oh, great.
1215280	1216440	What if you don't have your phone?
1216700	1218060	What if somebody steals your phone?
1218060	1223780	What if a malicious app on the phone exfiltrated that file?
1225300	1230040	So there is a cottage industry out there called, you know, Password Vault.
1230220	1231980	Maybe, have anybody used Password Vault?
1233760	1239540	I mean, some of them are, there are some free, but most of them are cost-mine.
1240380	1242380	And some companies do use those.
1243740	1246220	Okay, but guess what?
1246220	1250340	Well, when you have a company that runs the services, Password Vault Vault,
1250620	1255960	a third-party Password Vault Vault, they become like honey or a swarm of bees.
1257420	1262080	They are a super attractive attack target, and just like this DA that we talked about last time,
1262980	1264880	it's like, attack me.
1265520	1267420	Because this is where the friendly jewels are.
1267560	1270880	You get into a password-drawn company, you get into their databases,
1270880	1275280	whether through outside or inside attack, and you wind up with a big dirt.
1276220	1277380	Big prize, right?
1277640	1278380	Tons of passwords.
1279540	1282100	So I'm not clear that that's a good solution.
1283120	1285140	Then there's like denial of service issues, right?
1285180	1288100	If you store your passwords on your phone, if the phone is lost,
1288440	1290420	or like what happened to me a couple of months ago,
1290640	1292820	the phone just died, and there's no way.
1292920	1294740	I mean, it's dead beyond all salvation.
1295320	1297020	There's no way you can take anything out.
1297820	1300220	So now it's stuck with having to change all the passwords.
1300300	1301400	It's like a denial of service.
1301400	1304980	And for a while, your account's essentially off-limits to you.
1306780	1310520	One of the more interesting and super easy attacks, by the way,
1311640	1313280	with a denial of service goal.
1313980	1316900	Let's say you want to attack a particular company, right?
1316960	1320020	Let's say you have a company called XYZ Incorporated
1320020	1325280	that provides access to, I don't know, cute squirrel videos.
1325480	1327400	And they specialize in cute squirrels only.
1327980	1328760	No ugly squirrels.
1328760	1333140	And all the squirrel lovers in the world create accounts there
1333140	1335320	and just love, you know, it's like popular, right?
1335960	1338920	So all this community, probably not large,
1339040	1340460	because how many squirrel lovers out there,
1340940	1344980	they actively use this service,
1345320	1348780	and then somebody who wants to just piss them off
1348780	1353000	or maybe has a competing company decides to mount it in our service.
1353000	1356760	All they need to do is not break any passwords.
1358360	1362220	All they need to do is get a large enough sample of the usernames
1362220	1365420	or people who have an account.
1366340	1368520	All you do, you can program this.
1368640	1369980	You can run into this by hand.
1370280	1371620	Essentially, try to log in.
1371800	1373820	So for every account, let's say Alice has an account.
1374280	1376880	Write the username Alice, random password, click.
1378160	1379920	Username Bob, random password, click.
1379920	1382460	Do it three times, do it four times,
1382540	1383580	whatever the little threshold.
1383700	1384820	Use it, it's a little threshold.
1385580	1387760	For number of failed logins, right?
1388780	1389480	What happens?
1390300	1391700	You're locked out.
1393000	1394900	So when real users come back to log in,
1395320	1401020	due to the large number of successive failed login attempts,
1401140	1404400	you need to contact this 1-800 number in Mauritania.
1405020	1405620	Good luck.
1406300	1407200	With awful hours.
1407420	1408320	With, yes, of course.
1408320	1412180	We're only open between 3.30 and 4.30 p.m. Hawaii time.
1412500	1412980	Good luck.
1413720	1414620	Good luck, right?
1414700	1416500	Because then, of course, they want to make sure it's you.
1417220	1419580	Even if it's done in automated fashion
1419580	1420980	with some other second factor,
1421100	1422880	all back email, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1423260	1425560	It's a giant waste of time.
1426840	1427800	And a logistical nightmare.
1428020	1430040	So, a great attack.
1430660	1432520	You can program a bot to do this, right?
1432520	1437540	You can go for, like, even random usernames.
1438060	1441440	Eventually, you're going to find usernames that are existing.
1442200	1442960	Login, login, login.
1443240	1443520	Bam.
1444020	1444560	Locked out.
1445540	1446900	So, no passwords need to be broken.
1446900	1451260	So, let's see.
1451940	1453200	Then there's social engineering.
1453400	1456540	Social engineering is, like, this whole thing in its own right.
1457500	1460220	You can teach a class on that, just on social engineering.
1460400	1461880	But it's not really computer science.
1462640	1465140	Social engineering is all about how to trick people.
1466100	1468760	So, maybe more appropriate than psychology or some other department.
1469760	1473840	But it's a wonderful opportunity for attackers, right?
1473920	1477380	And a lot of spectacular hacks in this world that you've heard about
1477380	1478920	that sound really, really technical.
1480420	1484160	I suspect it's TouchNet and Mirai and all these other things.
1484160	1486280	I think they all, I'm pretty sure,
1486400	1489340	they all somehow involve elements of social engineering.
1490640	1492480	Social engineering means human.
1493740	1494000	Right?
1494000	1498500	Human interaction is elicitation of sensitive information
1498500	1501520	in verbal form.
1502160	1503660	Non-analog form.
1504580	1504800	Okay?
1505820	1508480	The typical social engineering attack
1508480	1510740	probably doesn't work at night today,
1510740	1511920	but, you know,
1513200	1514840	a CIO or a, let's say,
1514980	1516520	no, it's an IT person,
1517520	1518980	in the middle of the night,
1519060	1520860	in some department of some random company,
1521220	1522800	receives a panicked phone call
1522800	1524820	from the vice president
1524820	1527700	of, I don't know,
1527760	1528580	toilet affairs,
1528700	1529160	and says,
1529380	1531460	I am stuck in
1531460	1533540	Timbuktu
1533540	1534320	on a
1534320	1536440	very important company trip.
1536660	1537740	I'm dealing with clients.
1538360	1539160	All of a sudden,
1539800	1540640	my phone broke.
1541000	1541880	I cannot log in.
1542240	1542520	Help.
1542520	1544680	Millions of dollars
1544680	1546200	of business are at stake.
1546920	1548240	The panicked IT clerk,
1548940	1549580	who's sleepy,
1550300	1551200	and probably has,
1551600	1552380	I don't know,
1552960	1554520	DeVry Institute course
1554520	1555820	or education or something,
1556820	1557700	says,
1557920	1558800	oh, of course,
1559080	1559580	yes, sir.
1560020	1560760	And says,
1560760	1561120	okay,
1561240	1562700	here's a one-time login code,
1562760	1563300	go in this,
1563360	1563780	do this.
1564920	1565160	Yeah,
1565280	1565700	that's it.
1566020	1566780	That's the end of it.
1567360	1568160	That's the back door.
1568280	1569620	That allows the attacker
1569620	1570040	to get in.
1570400	1571560	It's still super common.
1571800	1572040	Yeah,
1572140	1572700	I'm sure,
1572880	1573100	you know,
1573180	1574560	every once in a while,
1575020	1576620	in a research literature,
1577000	1577940	or even at, like,
1578020	1578640	Black Hat,
1578720	1579180	DEFCON,
1579660	1580760	you will hear talks
1580760	1581420	about people saying,
1581520	1581740	okay,
1581880	1582760	we did this kind of
1582760	1583940	probing attack
1583940	1586100	against 500 companies
1586100	1586580	than, like,
1586640	1587000	Brazil,
1587120	1587800	I heard one talk.
1588560	1591500	And the particular talk
1591500	1592360	I heard is that,
1592360	1593620	you know,
1593680	1595540	when this was about
1595540	1596320	the attacks
1596320	1597560	on the Brazilian banks,
1597840	1598060	right,
1598140	1599220	and essentially utilizing
1599220	1600000	what I just described,
1600140	1601320	calling at random hours
1601320	1602700	and pretending to be somebody.
1602800	1604000	They didn't even invent somebody.
1604080	1604720	They actually pretended
1604720	1605200	to be somebody
1605200	1606100	who worked for the company.
1606100	1608140	So, you know,
1608200	1609560	the hackers know in advance.
1609640	1610480	They've done their research.
1610580	1610820	They've looked
1610820	1611700	for the company charts
1611700	1611960	and said,
1612200	1612880	who is awake?
1613060	1614140	Oh, this guy is on vacation.
1614620	1614820	So,
1614820	1616400	it is really believable
1616400	1618740	when most of it is true.
1619660	1620240	So, they call it,
1620240	1620420	say,
1620500	1621340	I'm so-and-so.
1621660	1622460	I'm on vacation
1622460	1623340	in Florida.
1624660	1624940	Oh,
1625660	1626020	so-and-so.
1626100	1626420	Yes,
1626540	1627160	he's on vacation.
1628940	1629840	Element of truth
1629840	1630680	goes a long way.
1632260	1632460	Right?
1632520	1633020	That's kind of
1633020	1633740	human psychology.
1634340	1634860	It works.
1635360	1636040	In the U.S.,
1636040	1636800	there were studies that,
1636920	1637380	oh, you know,
1637440	1638460	just like infomercials.
1638460	1638720	I don't know
1638720	1639260	if you even know
1639260	1640280	what infomercials are,
1640640	1642980	but this is a curious thing.
1642980	1644980	When Americans listen
1644980	1646560	to a voice
1646560	1649040	of a salesman,
1649300	1650000	it helps
1650000	1650920	if their voice
1650920	1652720	has a refined British accent.
1654640	1656040	Maybe you should wonder why.
1657420	1658640	If somebody speaks like they're
1658640	1659520	from the deep south,
1659980	1660480	forget it.
1660820	1661980	If somebody speaks like they're
1661980	1663040	from Brooklyn,
1663440	1664000	forget it.
1664400	1665260	But if somebody speaks
1665260	1667040	with a refined British accent,
1667360	1668700	carefully enunciating
1668700	1669980	every single syllable,
1670240	1671520	I'll do every single word
1671520	1672100	they say.
1673400	1674220	Most of us,
1674940	1675520	this country,
1676160	1676760	oh, yes,
1676860	1677240	I'm you.
1677700	1678240	What can I do?
1679320	1679520	Right?
1679940	1680700	So that's part
1680700	1681420	of social engineering.
1682860	1683140	Right?
1683360	1683540	So,
1684840	1685740	another reason is,
1685840	1686760	another way that it works
1686760	1687240	is the attacker
1687240	1688280	will know some information
1688280	1688900	about you.
1689040	1689180	Right?
1689240	1690480	So if they want to impersonate you
1690480	1691480	or want to get into your account,
1691540	1692220	they will know information.
1692740	1693820	Social security numbers,
1693940	1694560	days of birth,
1696160	1697160	those are a lot of difficult
1697160	1698000	things to find out.
1698000	1698240	Right?
1698360	1699160	Social security numbers
1699160	1700420	used to be believed
1700420	1701040	to be secret.
1701200	1701740	Nobody believes
1701740	1702820	to be secret in these days.
1703340	1704320	Even though we still
1704320	1705100	keep them private,
1705600	1706700	but I can buy
1706700	1707740	your social security number
1707740	1708500	if you have one.
1710180	1711100	It's not going to cost me
1711100	1711600	very much.
1711940	1713100	And so if I buy it,
1713140	1713780	even if it costs me
1713780	1714660	a couple hundred dollars,
1715100	1716260	it allows me essentially,
1716860	1717100	well,
1717220	1718240	not just social security,
1718340	1719100	but along with
1719100	1719700	other information
1719700	1720460	like David Burr,
1720620	1721320	driving the last time
1721320	1721580	in December,
1721680	1722660	maybe open a bank account
1722660	1723420	online.
1725620	1726060	Great.
1726060	1728460	If I open a bank account,
1728580	1729400	I can rent something
1729400	1729960	in your name.
1731740	1732540	Like an apartment.
1733420	1734620	Establish a gas company
1734620	1735880	relationship.
1736020	1736900	Electrical company.
1737100	1737220	Right?
1737400	1737760	Essentially,
1738260	1739320	start stealing your identity.
1743220	1743480	Yeah,
1743600	1743920	so,
1744260	1746220	this is like entertainment,
1746900	1748440	but anyway,
1748620	1750260	passwords are a pain.
1750260	1752120	So we're going to focus
1752120	1752640	for a moment
1752640	1753300	on the passwords.
1755960	1756680	There have been
1756680	1757520	tons of breaches
1757520	1757900	in the middle,
1757940	1758340	but by the way,
1758360	1759080	this is super old.
1759200	1759880	All these examples
1759880	1760480	are super old,
1760620	1760980	and yet,
1761660	1762560	I don't refresh them.
1764000	1765060	They're like 20 years old.
1765420	1765640	But,
1765880	1767100	this happens every year.
1768540	1769700	The similar things
1769700	1770500	that happened
1770500	1770820	20,
1770880	1771700	25 years ago
1771700	1772360	still happen.
1773900	1774040	Right?
1774040	1778860	If you go to the
1778860	1779920	website,
1780040	1781020	passwordpresearch.com,
1781080	1781620	they have lots
1781620	1782080	of interesting
1782080	1782420	articles.
1785000	1785280	Right?
1785440	1785620	So,
1785780	1786660	why do people
1786660	1787300	want your password?
1787500	1787780	So,
1787880	1788160	of course,
1788420	1789000	one of the reasons
1789000	1789940	they may want your password
1789940	1791800	is just to log in
1791800	1792820	and just delete your files.
1792940	1793640	They just hate you
1793640	1794460	and they want to
1794460	1794820	suck.
1795820	1796600	That doesn't happen
1796600	1797020	very often.
1798220	1798720	It can.
1798940	1799220	I mean,
1799820	1800700	you make some enemies,
1800940	1801560	you probably can.
1801560	1802000	But,
1802000	1802780	this is very personal.
1803920	1804320	Generally,
1805440	1806120	what somebody wants
1806120	1806860	is more than just
1806860	1807260	your password.
1807520	1807640	So,
1808720	1810220	installing a key log
1810220	1810760	or a sniffer
1810760	1812420	is another way.
1812980	1813600	And then,
1813840	1814360	basically,
1814920	1816220	you sniff for more passwords.
1817380	1818520	Especially if your account,
1818920	1819740	getting into your account,
1819820	1820300	is privileged.
1820480	1820600	Right?
1820660	1820780	So,
1820880	1821680	maybe it will be able
1821680	1822840	to run a sniffer
1822840	1823460	that will sniff
1823460	1824420	on other people's passwords.
1825580	1826420	The other thing
1826420	1827660	is to steal the password file.
1829260	1830000	And once you steal
1830000	1830800	the password file,
1830880	1831020	well,
1831020	1831720	then you can run
1831720	1834860	password cracking too much.
1835640	1836860	Because the password file,
1836960	1837820	as you can already imagine,
1838020	1838860	doesn't actually store
1838860	1839540	a real password,
1839680	1840480	but stores hashes.
1841580	1841800	Right?
1841860	1841980	So,
1842060	1842680	all you need to do
1842680	1843740	is try a brute force adapt.
1851620	1852060	Alright?
1852160	1852420	So,
1852640	1853820	Unix-style passwords
1853820	1854460	work like this,
1854520	1854680	right?
1854740	1855920	You enter your password,
1856240	1856940	it hashes,
1857080	1857760	and then this is
1857760	1858300	the etc.
1858520	1859780	etc. password file
1859780	1861040	that has one line
1861040	1861580	for a user,
1861740	1862060	generally,
1862800	1864020	and it contains,
1864160	1864860	among other things,
1865000	1865480	so the line,
1865680	1867000	the one line is like,
1867000	1867660	it's a text file.
1868060	1868200	So,
1868280	1869540	one line for a record,
1869880	1870060	oh,
1870180	1871440	one line is a record,
1871580	1872140	and this record
1872140	1873180	is for a given user,
1873680	1874440	and it has some
1874440	1875600	non-human accounts,
1876680	1876980	okay?
1876980	1878340	net, like root,
1878460	1879740	and admin,
1879860	1880200	or whatever,
1880400	1880780	some other,
1880860	1882020	some other cron account,
1882340	1883540	but it also has one
1883540	1884220	for every user.
1884660	1885020	And so,
1886080	1887020	when you enter a username,
1887540	1888420	the username is also
1888420	1889340	stored there in the clear.
1892840	1893240	So,
1893840	1895140	people realized early on
1895140	1896260	that it's not a good idea
1896260	1898040	to store a password there,
1898160	1899340	so why don't we store a hash?
1900320	1900680	So,
1900900	1901320	great,
1902400	1903360	the system doesn't know
1903360	1903960	your password,
1904840	1905880	it only knows the hash,
1906880	1907680	and because,
1908320	1908680	presumably,
1908780	1910100	we use a good cryptographic hash,
1910180	1912020	like the kind we talked about
1912020	1913120	briefly last time,
1914540	1915680	hash is supposed to be
1915680	1916560	one way.
1918580	1918820	Yeah?
1919800	1921300	One way means that,
1921300	1921940	yeah,
1922140	1922820	the inverting,
1922940	1923880	like knowing a hash,
1924220	1925440	and learning what the input
1925440	1926340	to the hash was,
1927000	1927540	is hard.
1929300	1930300	But is it really?
1931920	1933040	If the input space
1933040	1933840	is very large,
1934060	1934640	it is hard.
1936040	1937240	But if the input space
1937240	1938360	is constricted,
1939380	1940200	it might not be so hard.
1940480	1940980	But wait,
1941060	1941560	there's more.
1944160	1945020	Hashing is better
1945020	1945560	than encryption,
1945760	1946900	maybe you will realize why.
1947380	1947840	You know why?
1952780	1953520	I mean,
1955640	1956760	encrypting a block,
1958040	1958740	it should be,
1958960	1960280	it's usually roughly equivalent
1960280	1961180	to hashing a block.
1961180	1963360	All you think encryption
1963360	1965540	is not used.
1966540	1967460	And hashing is used.
1968980	1970100	No decryption.
1970860	1971680	No decryption.
1973300	1973940	Yeah,
1974120	1974960	that's a reason,
1975100	1975640	it's not that.
1975980	1976640	Major reason.
1977380	1978200	I hope you've never
1978200	1979300	had to see the thing
1979300	1980100	that's passed through
1980100	1981200	and that's been honest.
1981200	1982300	Okay,
1982360	1983140	now you're getting close.
1984200	1985460	What else does encryption
1985460	1986420	mean?
1987580	1988880	You want to encrypt the question.
1993620	1994040	No,
1994220	1995060	it leaks the length,
1995160	1995520	doesn't it?
1995940	1996160	Hmm.
1997520	1998460	So you want to have
1998460	1999220	the uniform
1999220	2001320	value,
2001580	2001860	right?
2002500	2003380	There are other reasons,
2003460	2004300	then you can think of some.
2005000	2005820	Encryption is not,
2005980	2006640	now encryption,
2006800	2007000	that's,
2007380	2008080	let me rephrase
2008080	2008520	what I said,
2008600	2009120	be very careful.
2011500	2012500	Encryption as in
2012500	2014380	something that can be reversed
2014380	2015520	is not used.
2016640	2017820	You can use encryption
2017820	2018820	to build a hash function.
2019000	2019840	An encryption function
2019840	2020460	can be used
2020460	2021260	to build a hash function.
2022960	2023320	Okay,
2023500	2024100	so it's okay
2024100	2025320	to use encryption function
2025320	2026420	to build a hash function
2026420	2027080	that you can use
2027080	2027660	for this purpose.
2028040	2028900	But what we don't do
2028900	2029760	is encrypt
2029760	2030880	the password itself.
2031880	2032120	Okay?
2032120	2036100	So remember the
2036100	2038220	properties of hash functions,
2038360	2038520	right?
2038600	2040240	So if you are a password hacker
2040240	2042120	and you want to
2042120	2043060	break the password,
2043480	2044180	what property
2044180	2044740	would you like
2044740	2045540	the hash function
2045540	2046280	not to have?
2049660	2050140	Well,
2050140	2051580	one way is we agree.
2051700	2052540	We all must have,
2052600	2052740	right?
2052740	2053740	Because it should be
2053740	2054720	difficult to go back
2054720	2055820	and figure out
2055820	2056460	from the hash
2056460	2057080	what the password
2057080	2057500	is going to be.
2058080	2058960	But what about
2058960	2059560	these other things?
2059680	2060040	Remember,
2060160	2060700	there's a strong
2060700	2061720	collision resistance
2061720	2063640	and weak collision resistance.
2065200	2066360	Which do we care
2066360	2067040	about?
2068900	2069460	Yeah.
2069840	2070340	Strong
2070340	2071820	would be nice to have
2071820	2073560	but not super important
2073560	2075200	because
2075200	2077020	the password
2077020	2078000	is specific,
2078120	2078240	right?
2078280	2078720	It's given.
2079980	2080860	It's given
2080860	2082440	to the hacker
2082440	2083860	but it's fixed
2083860	2084480	by the hash,
2084840	2085100	right?
2085720	2086420	So in order
2086420	2087480	to break
2087480	2088220	the system
2088220	2088800	without learning
2088800	2089360	the password,
2089360	2090920	the hacker
2090920	2091640	has to find
2091640	2092760	another password
2092760	2094280	that hashes
2094280	2095320	into the same value.
2096720	2097240	Does that make sense?
2098520	2099700	So if your password
2099700	2100360	is Apple
2100360	2101660	and it hashes
2101660	2101920	into
2101920	2103620	345
2103620	2105800	and I pick
2105800	2107100	Pear
2107100	2107940	and it also
2107940	2108480	hashes into
2108480	2109020	the 345
2109020	2109760	I don't need
2109760	2110060	to know
2110060	2110520	Apple.
2112200	2112960	I can just
2112960	2113620	log into your account
2113620	2114460	by typing Pear.
2114460	2116380	OK?
2117440	2117880	So
2117880	2119520	that weak collision
2119520	2119860	resistance
2119860	2120760	and that's
2120760	2121200	what we need.
2127000	2127480	So
2127480	2129140	I'm not sure
2129140	2129380	how many
2129380	2130020	to do it
2130020	2130680	but historically
2130680	2131160	that's what
2131160	2131660	has been done
2131660	2132740	is that
2132740	2134320	Linux
2134320	2135040	was using
2135040	2135520	DES
2135520	2137940	encryption
2137940	2139420	as a hash
2139420	2139700	function.
2139700	2140760	Now how
2140760	2141420	does it do it?
2141680	2141960	Well,
2142080	2142460	it takes
2142460	2143100	a null
2143100	2143580	string
2143580	2145580	a 64-bit
2145580	2146620	now you remember
2146620	2148360	DES is a 64-bit block
2148360	2149320	so it takes
2149320	2150380	a string of
2150380	2150620	0
2150620	2151500	64-bits
2151500	2151840	long
2151840	2152780	and then
2152780	2153780	encrypts it
2153780	2154400	repeatedly
2154400	2155120	OK?
2155560	2156180	Repeatedly
2156180	2157160	25 times
2157160	2158800	using
2158800	2159880	a DES
2159880	2160240	key
2160240	2160900	that is
2160900	2161260	derived
2161260	2161560	from the
2161560	2161880	password.
2163980	2164220	OK?
2165700	2166260	Make sense?
2166260	2167920	So it converts
2167920	2168460	your password
2168460	2169320	into a key
2169320	2170720	now that's
2170720	2171080	also
2171080	2172060	an interesting
2172060	2172380	detail
2172380	2172820	because
2172820	2173820	DES keys
2173820	2174280	are actually
2174280	2175180	56-bits
2175180	2175560	long
2175560	2176560	I mean
2176560	2177180	they're 64
2177180	2177860	but 8-bits
2177860	2178680	are parity-bits
2178680	2179460	so
2179460	2181500	that's an
2181500	2182140	interesting one
2182140	2184100	so we'll come
2184100	2184560	back to that
2184560	2185100	in a second.
2185720	2186140	The idea
2186140	2186720	so why do
2186720	2187380	they do this
2187380	2188200	or why did
2188200	2188840	they do this
2188840	2190180	because in
2190180	2190640	order to
2190640	2191460	mount a
2191460	2193960	brute force
2193960	2194340	attack
2194340	2194980	on a password
2194980	2196360	you would
2196360	2196680	have to
2196680	2197060	guess the
2197060	2197520	password
2197520	2199280	and perform
2199280	2201460	25
2201460	2202480	encryptions
2202480	2204720	or
2204720	2205380	if you like
2205380	2205840	25
2205840	2206300	decryptions
2206300	2207700	and at
2207700	2208160	the end
2208160	2209800	OK?
2211480	2211840	If you
2211840	2212420	hit 0
2212420	2213580	if what
2213580	2214120	you decrypt
2214120	2214920	after 25
2214920	2215480	decryptions
2215480	2215940	and 0
2215940	2216280	and a
2216280	2216620	string of
2216620	2216960	0s
2216960	2217520	you guessed
2217520	2217960	correctly.
2220800	2221400	OK?
2222140	2222600	Or
2222600	2223240	alternatively
2223240	2223540	you would
2223540	2223820	take
2223820	2224400	a string
2224400	2224960	of 0s
2224960	2226080	and encrypt
2226080	2226600	it 25
2226600	2227060	times
2227060	2227760	and see
2227760	2228100	if that
2228100	2228460	matches
2228460	2229020	the result
2229020	2229300	in the
2229300	2229600	password
2229600	2229940	file.
2231380	2231660	Am I
2231660	2232000	with you?
2232720	2232960	Any
2232960	2233260	questions?
2235100	2235620	So
2235620	2236100	it's a
2236100	2236660	clever idea
2236660	2236900	right?
2236960	2237260	The idea
2237260	2237640	was to
2237640	2238220	slow down
2238220	2238380	the
2238380	2238680	attacker
2238680	2239320	25
2239320	2240120	that is
2240120	2240620	for every
2240620	2241100	guess
2241100	2242700	of a
2242700	2243060	password
2243060	2243780	or every
2243780	2244880	possible
2244880	2245280	password
2245280	2245680	the attacker
2245680	2246040	guesses
2246040	2247240	it would
2247240	2247540	have to
2247540	2248120	perform
2248120	2249280	25
2249280	2250320	encryption
2250320	2250980	or decryption
2250980	2251460	operations.
2251460	2254460	that's
2254460	2254820	a lot
2254820	2255940	and back
2255940	2256380	then
2256380	2257400	DESC was
2257400	2257820	implemented
2257820	2258300	mostly in
2258300	2258620	hardware
2258620	2258900	it was
2258900	2259320	very slow
2259320	2259800	in software
2259800	2260680	so it
2260680	2261180	seemed like
2261180	2261700	a good idea.
2262300	2262680	And then
2262680	2263380	of course
2263380	2264360	passwords aren't
2264360	2265020	really random
2265020	2265380	right?
2266820	2267700	Doesn't matter
2267700	2269080	how old you
2269080	2269580	are, doesn't
2269580	2270040	matter what
2270040	2270620	culture
2270620	2271140	or which
2271140	2271600	country
2271600	2272040	which
2272040	2272940	ethnicity
2272940	2273560	you come
2273560	2273920	from
2273920	2275040	within the
2275040	2275540	group that
2275540	2275960	you come
2275960	2276240	from
2276240	2277280	you're
2277280	2277900	likely to
2277900	2278300	pick a
2278300	2278680	password
2278680	2280000	that is
2280000	2280280	not
2280280	2280520	truly
2280520	2280920	random.
2281960	2282280	There's
2282280	2282680	no such
2282680	2283100	thing as
2283100	2283460	humans
2283460	2283780	picking
2283780	2284540	truly
2284540	2284920	random
2284920	2285300	passwords.
2285700	2286140	Even if
2286140	2286460	you say
2286460	2286780	well
2286780	2287660	I know
2287660	2289480	a certain
2289480	2289940	date
2289940	2290780	where
2290780	2291100	let's
2291100	2291440	say
2291440	2292700	I
2292700	2292800	don't
2292800	2293060	know
2293060	2295140	I
2295140	2295660	graduated
2295660	2296040	from
2296040	2296520	college
2296520	2296960	or
2296960	2297440	I
2297440	2298020	had
2298020	2298180	my
2298180	2298480	first
2298480	2298980	date
2298980	2299380	or
2299380	2300880	something
2300880	2301760	auspicious
2301760	2302260	happened
2302260	2302520	on a
2302520	2302840	particular
2302840	2303140	date
2303140	2304080	and
2304080	2304400	nobody
2304400	2304620	else
2304620	2304860	knows
2304860	2305080	it
2305080	2305700	just
2305700	2305980	you
2305980	2307120	you
2307120	2307340	think
2307340	2307560	that
2307560	2307760	might
2307760	2307900	be
2307900	2308220	random
2308220	2308440	but
2308440	2308700	actually
2308700	2308880	it's
2308880	2309140	not.
2311460	2311640	I
2311640	2311880	think
2311880	2312080	about
2312080	2312560	are
2312560	2312860	dates
2312860	2313140	really
2313140	2313480	random?
2314460	2314680	There's
2314680	2314880	a lot
2314880	2314980	of
2314980	2315160	people
2315160	2315420	use
2315420	2315580	them
2315580	2316040	professionally.
2317480	2317720	Think
2317720	2317900	about
2317900	2318100	how
2318100	2318260	we
2318260	2318600	structure
2318600	2319020	dates.
2321220	2321580	Forget
2321580	2322200	hours
2322200	2322380	a
2322380	2322520	minute
2322520	2322780	just
2322780	2323120	dates.
2324580	2324740	I
2324740	2324860	mean
2324860	2325180	depending
2325180	2325340	on
2325340	2326200	which
2326200	2326600	notation
2326600	2326780	it
2326780	2327020	used
2327020	2327140	to
2327140	2327280	them
2327280	2327400	in
2327400	2327500	the
2327500	2327700	United
2327700	2328040	States
2328040	2328220	we
2328220	2328460	use
2328460	2329280	month
2329280	2329860	day
2329860	2330440	year
2330440	2330940	right?
2332400	2332680	How
2332680	2332860	many
2332860	2333140	months
2333140	2333280	are
2333280	2333500	there?
2334720	2335180	Well
2335180	2336000	last time I
2336000	2336220	said
2336220	2338220	how many
2338220	2338680	days are
2338680	2338880	there?
2339080	2339480	Let's be
2339480	2340100	generous and
2340100	2340700	say 51
2340700	2341100	in every
2341100	2341380	month
2341380	2341700	right?
2342440	2342720	They're
2342720	2342980	honest
2342980	2343300	right?
2343520	2344160	Let's say
2344160	2344400	they're
2344400	2344720	out because
2344720	2345020	they're
2345020	2345540	the maximum
2345540	2346760	and how many
2346760	2347280	years is it?
2347380	2347700	Well
2347700	2348140	there are a lot
2348140	2348580	of years
2348580	2349940	but you're not
2349940	2350800	likely to pick
2350800	2351580	a year from
2351580	2353040	dark ages
2353040	2354280	history
2354280	2354300	history
2354300	2355680	and
2355680	2356360	yeah
2356360	2357240	if you're
2357240	2357560	a fan
2357560	2357920	of history
2357920	2358320	you might
2358320	2358560	pick
2358560	2358880	something
2358880	2362460	ancient
2362460	2362900	Egyptian
2362900	2363280	era
2363280	2363580	or
2363580	2364340	something
2364340	2364800	from
2364800	2365620	the
2365620	2365880	time
2365880	2366120	of
2366120	2367020	William
2367020	2367200	the
2367200	2367700	Conqueror
2367700	2367960	but
2367960	2368980	most of
2368980	2369120	us
2369120	2369400	would pick
2369400	2369680	something
2369680	2370080	reasonably
2370080	2370420	more
2370420	2371060	1940
2371060	2371720	21st
2371720	2372020	century
2372020	2372420	so
2372420	2372600	that
2372600	2372920	does not
2372920	2373100	be
2373100	2373400	vulnerable
2373400	2374280	that's
2374280	2374540	not
2374540	2375000	random
2375000	2376740	and the
2376740	2377100	space
2377100	2377380	of that
2377380	2377500	is
2377500	2377740	very
2377740	2378100	small
2378100	2379640	so
2379640	2379820	don't
2379820	2379980	pick
2379980	2380260	dates
2380260	2381020	in any
2381020	2381340	format
2381340	2383720	right
2383720	2383920	so
2383920	2384160	but if
2384160	2384440	you just
2384440	2384780	look at
2384780	2385000	the
2385000	2385860	52
2385860	2386380	upper
2386380	2386560	and
2386560	2386840	lower
2386840	2387220	case
2387220	2387820	letters
2387820	2389440	that is
2389440	2389640	being
2389640	2390040	generous
2390040	2390440	assuming
2390440	2390740	that
2390740	2391120	whatever
2391120	2391520	system
2391520	2391720	we're
2391720	2391960	working
2391960	2392800	distinguishes
2392800	2393160	between
2393160	2393440	upper
2393440	2393600	and
2393600	2393740	lower
2393740	2393900	case
2393900	2394160	because
2394160	2394540	some
2394540	2395620	systems
2395620	2395860	do
2395860	2396120	not
2396120	2396600	right
2396600	2397520	they'll
2397520	2397760	just
2397760	2398420	convert
2398420	2398800	everything
2398800	2399000	to
2399000	2399180	upper
2399180	2399500	case
2399500	2399680	or
2399680	2400000	lower
2400000	2400200	case
2400200	2400840	so
2400840	2401520	52
2401520	2402420	in English
2402420	2402740	20
2402740	2403040	that's
2403040	2403620	26
2403620	2404460	26 times
2404460	2404680	2
2404680	2404920	plus
2404920	2405160	10
2405160	2405620	digits
2405620	2407080	and
2407080	2407480	32
2407480	2408160	punctuation
2408160	2408560	symbols
2408560	2409120	although
2409120	2410860	many
2410860	2411700	password
2411700	2412760	rules
2412760	2413180	will not
2413180	2413540	allow you
2413540	2413780	to use
2413780	2414260	punctuation
2414260	2415600	they might
2415600	2416000	allow you
2416000	2416400	to use
2416400	2416700	like
2416700	2418100	exclamation
2418100	2418660	point
2418660	2419280	the question
2419280	2419800	mark
2419800	2420620	the dot
2420620	2421020	and maybe
2421020	2421760	that's it
2421760	2422820	but okay
2422820	2423200	let's be
2423200	2423560	generous
2423560	2424840	so that
2424840	2425300	gives us
2425300	2425740	52
2425740	2426340	plus 10
2426340	2427040	plus 32
2427040	2428500	that's
2428500	2428980	94
2428980	2431180	and let's
2431180	2431560	say we
2431560	2432040	limit to
2432040	2432720	8 characters
2432720	2434600	because
2434600	2436720	that's
2436720	2437200	pretty much
2437200	2437880	how many
2437880	2438120	of you
2438120	2438300	have
2438300	2438760	passwords
2438760	2439200	that I
2439200	2439560	exceed
2439560	2440220	8 characters
2440220	2442940	yeah
2442940	2443880	I buy
2443880	2444240	a lot
2444240	2445060	how many
2445060	2445580	exceed
2445580	2446340	12 characters
2446340	2448520	look at

2455420	2456400	because
2456400	2456760	there's
2456760	2457060	a big
2457060	2457460	trade-off
2457460	2457700	here
2457700	2458000	right
2458000	2459020	the big
2459020	2459520	trade-off
2459520	2459920	is
2459920	2460840	okay
2460840	2461100	so
2461100	2461360	let's
2461360	2461500	say
2461500	2463180	I'm
2463180	2463440	not going

2464720	2464920	your
2464920	2465220	password
2465220	2465500	here
2465500	2466840	but let's
2466840	2467100	say you
2467100	2467240	have
2467240	2467560	15
2467560	2467900	character
2467900	2468360	password
2468360	2469300	and
2469300	2470520	he has
2470520	2470900	an 8
2470900	2471340	character
2471340	2471760	password
2471760	2472900	now we
2472900	2473020	have
2473020	2473600	usability
2473600	2474120	issue
2474120	2475620	let's
2475620	2475820	say
2475820	2476100	you're
2476100	2476500	young
2476500	2477040	you're
2477040	2477380	smart
2477380	2477720	you can
2477720	2478120	remember
2478120	2478500	15
2478500	2478820	characters
2478820	2479380	obviously
2479380	2479820	you can
2479820	2480060	right
2480060	2483300	but what
2483300	2483480	about
2483480	2483780	making
2483780	2484420	mistakes
2484420	2485580	in
2485580	2485740	those
2485740	2486020	15
2486020	2486440	characters
2486440	2486780	as you
2486780	2487060	type
2487060	2488900	have
2488900	2489020	we
2489020	2489220	never
2489220	2489420	did
2489420	2489840	mistakes
2489840	2493840	right
2493840	2494580	how likely
2494580	2494980	let's
2494980	2495380	put it
2495380	2495720	another way
2495720	2496260	how likely
2496260	2496440	are you
2496440	2496700	to make
2496700	2497100	a mistake
2497100	2497380	in an
2497380	2497540	8
2497540	2497880	character
2497880	2498280	password
2498280	2498760	as opposed
2498760	2498980	to a
2498980	2499220	15
2499220	2499580	character
2499580	2499960	password
2499960	2501820	much more
2501820	2502120	likely
2502120	2502680	there are
2502680	2502860	some
2502860	2503100	people
2503100	2503700	fatigued
2503700	2503920	right
2503920	2504260	I mean
2504260	2504820	finger
2504820	2505260	fatigued
2505260	2505660	you have
2505660	2506060	to stare
2506060	2506260	at the
2506260	2506500	keyword
2506500	2507600	so
2507600	2507880	there's
2507880	2508160	that
2508160	2509480	second
2509480	2509780	issue
2509780	2510100	is the
2510100	2510460	time
2510460	2511380	it just
2511380	2511580	takes
2511580	2511940	longer
2511940	2513400	to enter
2513400	2513620	that
2513620	2513940	password
2513940	2515980	so
2515980	2517360	while I
2517360	2518100	find it
2518100	2518580	commendable
2518580	2518920	that you
2518920	2519360	guys use
2519360	2519800	this long
2519800	2520220	password
2520220	2520700	that's
2520700	2521000	great
2521000	2523480	that doesn't
2523480	2523860	mean you're
2523860	2524200	out of the
2524200	2524440	woods
2524440	2525020	with attacks
2525020	2525900	you know
2525900	2526600	but
2526600	2527840	there is a
2527840	2528220	trade-off
2528220	2528700	right
2528700	2529140	and most
2529140	2529400	people
2529400	2529800	I mean
2529800	2530480	they're okay
2530480	2530900	with like
2530900	2531540	not super
2531540	2531860	short
2531860	2532220	passwords
2532220	2533060	but like
2533060	2533660	research
2533660	2534280	show that
2534280	2534660	8 is
2534660	2534980	about
2534980	2536160	the right
2536160	2536540	mix
2536540	2537680	but with
2537680	2537860	8
2537860	2538140	characters
2538160	2538800	which is
2538800	2539240	I think
2539240	2539780	for most
2539780	2540100	people
2540100	2540880	and I
2540880	2541240	suspect
2541240	2541780	most people
2541780	2542240	your age
2542240	2542640	have picked
2542640	2543220	some better
2543220	2543680	passwords
2543680	2544160	than let's
2544160	2544500	say your
2544500	2544880	uncles
2544880	2546000	and grandparents
2546000	2547020	and parents
2547020	2548440	because you
2548440	2548580	know
2548580	2549320	who are less
2549320	2549720	confused
2549720	2550040	having
2550040	2550760	you're going
2550760	2551240	to wind up
2551240	2552400	with roughly
2552400	2553560	6 quadrillion
2553560	2555680	possible passwords
2555680	2557060	well to a
2557060	2557520	kid this
2557520	2558120	sounds really
2558120	2558620	impressive
2558620	2558980	right
2558980	2559380	you just
2559380	2559960	explain how
2559960	2560420	many zeros
2560420	2560720	are
2560720	2561360	but we're
2561360	2561880	all adults
2561880	2562160	here
2562160	2563100	6 quadrillion
2563100	2563580	is not a
2563580	2564080	large number
2564080	2566100	okay
2566100	2567000	not at all
2567000	2568480	right
2568480	2569580	and
2569580	2571120	since
2571120	2572240	given
2572240	2573620	freedom
2573620	2574140	to pick
2574140	2574380	right
2574380	2575000	without like
2575000	2575620	actual
2575620	2576160	restriction
2576160	2577900	most of us
2577900	2578300	will pick
2578300	2579040	things like
2579040	2579900	human and
2579900	2580500	pet names
2580500	2581040	and dictionary
2581040	2581500	words
2581500	2582400	we're going to
2582400	2582840	wind up
2582840	2583200	with
2583200	2585120	20
2585120	2586020	2 to the
2586020	2586340	20
2586340	2586860	essentially
2586860	2587480	a 20-bit
2587480	2587840	password
2587840	2589640	which means
2589640	2589940	that
2589940	2590780	even if
2590780	2591160	your password
2591160	2591520	is 8
2591520	2591980	characters
2591980	2593260	the real
2593260	2593740	entropy
2593740	2594060	there
2594060	2594180	is
2594180	2594360	about
2594360	2594640	20
2594640	2594920	minutes
2594920	2599260	meaning
2599260	2599580	that
2599580	2600260	human
2600260	2600760	death
2600760	2601200	names
2601200	2601580	and all
2601580	2602180	the dictionary
2602180	2602600	words
2602600	2603160	will roughly
2603160	2603620	be about
2603620	2603900	2 to the
2603900	2604060	point
2604060	2604520	that's
2604520	2604800	assuming
2604800	2605240	the language
2605240	2605660	is known
2605660	2606200	so you
2606200	2606440	assume
2606440	2606860	your password
2606860	2607800	is English
2607800	2608180	like
2608180	2609680	if you
2609680	2609980	are
2609980	2611220	Swahili
2611220	2611720	speaker
2611720	2612720	then a whole
2612720	2613000	different
2613000	2613260	thing
2613260	2613700	will apply
2613700	2614520	it will
2614520	2615000	be based
2615000	2615520	on the
2615520	2616280	vocabulary
2616280	2616720	of that
2616720	2617000	language
2617000	2617840	but
2617840	2618000	you
2618000	2618140	have
2618140	2618240	to
2618240	2618520	assume
2618520	2618680	that
2618680	2618900	hacker
2618900	2619180	knows
2619180	2619380	about
2619380	2619520	that
2619520	2622860	yeah
2622860	2623460	so
2623460	2624060	and
2624060	2624280	if you
2624280	2624460	think
2624460	2624780	pins
2624780	2624920	are
2624920	2625200	better
2625200	2625660	they're
2625660	2626000	not
2626000	2627080	because
2627080	2628040	you
2628040	2628540	get
2628540	2629080	with
2629080	2629900	maximum
2629900	2630460	2 to the
2630460	2630980	27
2630980	2631520	with
2631520	2631880	8
2631880	2632340	digit
2632340	2632800	pins
2632800	2637200	and
2637200	2637520	that's
2637520	2637900	something
2637900	2638260	that
2638260	2638920	any
2638920	2641040	software
2641040	2641520	on your
2641520	2641760	phone
2641760	2642080	you can
2642080	2642740	do
2642740	2643180	in
2643180	2643940	seconds
2643940	2645340	just
2645340	2645740	iterate
2645740	2646140	for all
2646140	2646380	of those
2646380	2646580	so
2646580	2646800	that's
2646800	2647060	not a
2647060	2647260	scary
2647260	2647600	number
2647600	2648440	on
2648440	2648580	the
2648580	2649080	websites
2649080	2649940	they often
2649940	2650780	restrict
2650780	2651360	length
2651360	2651640	for
2651640	2652960	I get
2652960	2653460	they have
2653460	2653780	to store
2653780	2654080	in a
2654080	2654500	database
2654500	2654860	somehow
2654860	2655800	but why
2655800	2657600	in the
2657600	2657940	world
2657940	2658300	would they
2658300	2658580	ever
2658580	2658780	that
2658780	2659000	takes
2659000	2659480	no sense
2659480	2659800	to me
2659800	2660000	either
2660000	2660360	symbols
2660360	2661200	they
2661200	2662280	so
2662280	2662860	I think
2662860	2663380	the reason
2663380	2663800	okay
2663800	2664740	you're asking
2664740	2665300	two questions
2665300	2666140	why do they
2666140	2666460	restrict
2666460	2666800	the length
2666800	2667540	and why
2667540	2667920	they don't
2667920	2668120	allow
2668120	2668480	symbols
2668480	2669920	none of
2669920	2670320	those two
2670320	2670680	none of
2670680	2671000	those two
2671000	2671480	make sense
2671480	2671920	to me
2671920	2672540	but I have
2672540	2673320	a potential
2673320	2673980	explanation
2673980	2675040	for why
2675040	2675220	they don't
2675220	2675780	allow certain
2675780	2676220	symbols
2676220	2676720	is because
2676720	2677320	they think
2677320	2678040	these are
2678040	2678600	executable
2678600	2679020	some kind
2679020	2679320	of like
2679320	2679520	they're
2679520	2680320	trigger symbols
2680320	2681920	that somehow
2681920	2683400	some of
2683400	2684020	these things
2684020	2684440	like
2684440	2687480	slash slash
2687480	2688200	or back
2688200	2688700	slash back
2688700	2689840	dollar sign
2689840	2690560	can be used
2690560	2692480	if you somehow
2692480	2693380	cause a buffer
2693380	2693960	overflow
2693960	2695460	they can
2695460	2696420	so there's
2696420	2696820	some like
2696820	2697560	suspicion
2697560	2698920	of these symbols
2698920	2700220	dating back years
2700220	2700860	nobody really
2700860	2701520	knows why
2701520	2702520	but that's
2702520	2703120	my suspicion
2703120	2703900	why
2703900	2704360	do they
2704360	2705240	truncate
2705240	2707080	and allow
2707080	2707600	only
2707600	2708680	fixed
2708680	2709700	up to a certain
2709700	2710020	number of
2710020	2710220	characters
2710220	2710860	I don't know
2710860	2711140	that
2711140	2712540	that may be
2712540	2714280	it makes no
2714280	2715060	sense because
2715060	2716780	it's hashed
2716780	2718820	and it may be
2718820	2719460	again that
2719460	2720440	whoever programmed
2720440	2721280	the front end
2721280	2724120	no
2724120	2725860	they're also
2725860	2726540	afraid of
2726540	2727040	these kind
2727040	2727440	of buffer
2727440	2728100	overflows
2728100	2728640	and so on
2728640	2729120	and memory
2729120	2729820	bugs
2729820	2730920	because
2730920	2731300	you allow
2731300	2732120	unlimited number
2732120	2732740	of characters
2732740	2733300	they're thinking
2733300	2733720	you're going to
2733720	2734520	enter 2,000
2734520	2735040	characters
2735040	2735980	something is going
2735980	2736340	to break
2736340	2736800	in the code
2736800	2738300	I know
2738300	2738860	I know
2738860	2739920	I'm with you
2739920	2740240	on that
2740240	2740960	I think that's
2740960	2741240	silly
2741240	2742460	right because
2742460	2743240	there's no
2743240	2743800	justification
2743800	2744760	it's only the
2744760	2745260	front end
2745260	2746860	because of the
2746860	2747380	back end
2747380	2748400	they're hashed
2748400	2748740	and they're all
2748740	2749340	the same way
2749340	2758280	it's a heat
2758280	2758480	map
2758480	2759400	some of the
2759400	2759980	stuff I'll show
2759980	2760480	you is really
2760480	2760880	dated
2760880	2762300	dated as in
2762300	2762940	like 10 years
2762940	2763200	old
2763200	2763820	more than 10
2763820	2764060	years old
2764060	2764660	none of it
2764660	2765380	changed since
2765380	2767120	people still
2767120	2767500	think
2767500	2769260	similar
2769260	2769540	faster
2769540	2770040	because the
2770040	2770440	fundamental
2770440	2770900	human
2770900	2772040	mentality
2772040	2772360	hasn't
2772360	2772680	changed
2772680	2774380	what is
2774380	2774720	a heat
2774720	2774900	map
2774900	2775120	what does
2775120	2775440	it mean
2775440	2775920	is that
2775920	2776500	you see
2776500	2776840	where
2776840	2778120	things are
2778120	2778480	really
2778480	2779480	hot
2779480	2779700	there
2779700	2780020	yellow
2780020	2780500	right
2780500	2783760	and so
2783760	2784600	over here
2784600	2785380	it's a heat
2785380	2786020	map generated
2786020	2786820	from a
2786820	2787080	leaked
2787080	2787560	password
2787560	2788140	database
2788140	2789460	a giant
2789460	2789800	leaked
2789800	2790200	password
2790200	2790540	database
2790540	2791520	okay
2791520	2793240	so
2793240	2795060	this is
2795060	2797060	a pin
2797060	2797400	sorry
2797400	2797860	this is not
2797860	2798520	a pin
2798520	2799020	heat map
2799020	2799860	and so
2799860	2800260	over here
2800260	2800620	where it's
2800620	2801260	really hot
2801260	2803440	dates
2803440	2805640	dates are
2805640	2805980	different
2805980	2806580	from other
2806580	2806900	pins
2806900	2807700	this is
2807700	2809280	you know
2809280	2809820	day
2809820	2810080	day
2810080	2810340	month
2810340	2810640	month
2810640	2810920	type
2810920	2811240	dates
2811240	2811560	right
2811560	2812600	and then
2812600	2813880	related couplets
2813880	2814560	meaning repeated
2814560	2815420	things like
2815420	2816060	0101
2816060	2817620	0505
2817620	2819100	667
2819100	2820680	they're all
2820680	2821260	along this
2821260	2822700	diagonal thing
2822700	2824280	okay
2824280	2826220	and these are
2826220	2826980	years of
2826980	2827740	specific years
2827740	2828760	of 19 something
2828760	2832320	because probably
2832320	2833000	birth years
2833000	2833600	people
2833600	2833620	for people
2833620	2835080	to take
2835080	2835460	passwords
2835460	2835720	back
2835720	2839220	so
2839220	2840260	as I said
2840260	2840700	before
2840700	2841460	the
2841460	2843160	Unix
2843160	2843800	and all
2843800	2844140	the other
2844140	2844500	Unix
2844500	2845980	like systems
2845980	2846760	have this
2846760	2847600	etsy
2847600	2848540	password file
2848540	2848900	and it's
2848900	2849480	world readable
2849480	2850320	for reasons
2850320	2850620	I already
2850620	2851060	explained
2851060	2852560	so
2852560	2855460	if you don't
2855460	2855960	do anything
2855960	2856300	and just
2856300	2856960	store the
2856960	2858620	hashed
2858620	2859080	passwords
2859080	2859520	in that
2859520	2859920	file
2859920	2861120	the attacker
2861120	2861560	will
2861560	2863340	easily
2863340	2864000	before
2864000	2865560	even knowing
2865560	2865960	what that
2865960	2866480	file is
2866480	2867120	before breaking
2867120	2867800	in or getting
2867800	2868220	an accident
2868220	2868960	the attacker
2868960	2869800	can precompute
2869800	2871160	a large table
2871160	2871800	of all the
2871800	2872060	hashed
2872060	2872400	passwords
2872400	2874800	yeah
2874800	2876900	I mean
2876900	2877620	passwords are
2877620	2878220	passwords right
2878220	2878700	you can just
2878700	2879200	pick all the
2879200	2880180	dictionary words
2880180	2881060	all the dictionary
2881060	2881440	words are
2881440	2881800	reversed
2881800	2882500	all the
2882500	2882920	two word
2882920	2883500	combination
2883500	2885200	let's restrict
2885200	2885840	our discussion
2885840	2886340	to English
2886340	2886780	for now
2886780	2887160	okay
2887160	2887800	because
2887800	2888720	similar things
2888720	2889200	apply to
2889200	2890620	other languages
2890620	2891280	but let's say
2891280	2891760	yeah
2891760	2892760	all the date
2892760	2894700	in a standard
2894700	2895680	US format
2895680	2896620	all the
2896620	2897540	even times
2897540	2898060	of day
2898060	2898760	using
2898760	2899460	you know
2899460	2900040	after a second
2900040	2900440	let's say
2900440	2901040	granularity
2901040	2901740	you can precompute
2901740	2902480	hashes of all
2902480	2903120	these values
2903120	2904000	combinations
2904000	2904620	of all these
2904620	2905060	values
2905060	2906160	pet names
2906160	2907700	city names
2907700	2909520	state names
2909520	2911120	university
2911120	2912400	mascot names
2912400	2913560	right
2913560	2914920	all of these
2914920	2915820	can be precomputed
2915820	2916260	in a large
2916260	2916500	database
2916500	2917300	stored in a large
2917300	2917560	database
2917560	2918720	that is something
2918720	2919420	a task that
2919420	2919880	an adversary
2919880	2920520	could do
2920520	2921480	and would take
2921480	2922240	maybe a day
2922240	2922580	or two
2922580	2923360	maybe less
2923360	2924500	this can be
2924500	2924880	stored
2924880	2925420	and it can be
2925420	2925920	done at your
2925920	2926360	own leisure
2926360	2927320	now
2927320	2928000	at the time
2928000	2928640	of intrusion
2928640	2929220	when the
2929220	2930020	adversary gains
2930020	2930620	access to
2930620	2931760	the password
2931760	2932220	file
2932220	2932720	all the
2932720	2933080	adversary
2933080	2933600	needs to
2933600	2933860	do
2933860	2935020	is extract
2935020	2935460	the hashed
2935460	2935900	passports
2935900	2936360	and do it
2936360	2936640	database
2936640	2937040	basically
2937040	2939660	am I with you
2939660	2941040	very simple
2941040	2942740	so a little bit
2942740	2943300	of work ahead
2943300	2943640	of it
2943640	2945260	and then
2945260	2945900	no work
2945900	2946400	essentially
2946400	2947320	once the
2947320	2948460	password file
2948460	2949160	becomes available
2949160	2950620	not only that
2950620	2950900	but the
2950900	2951380	adversary can
2951380	2951780	break into
2951780	2952740	multiple systems
2952740	2954120	and reuse
2954120	2954700	that same
2954700	2955520	work that
2955520	2956180	we did
2956180	2956700	earlier
2956700	2957640	right
2957640	2958120	it's not like
2958120	2958520	he has to
2958520	2959280	brute force
2959280	2959980	anything again
2959980	2961180	just a bunch
2961180	2961680	of database
2961680	2962120	who comes
2962120	2964460	so that's
2964460	2964980	nice
2964980	2965500	for the
2965500	2965880	adversary
2965880	2966600	bad for
2966600	2966900	us
2966900	2969020	right
2969020	2970800	this is
2970800	2971200	called an
2971200	2971680	offline
2971680	2972120	attack
2972120	2973740	because the
2973740	2974380	adversary has
2974380	2974800	done the
2974800	2975180	bulk of
2975180	2975580	the work
2975580	2976240	offline
2976240	2977800	and online
2977800	2978260	just does
2978260	2978740	lookouts
2978740	2983340	so that's
2983340	2983880	why salt
2983880	2985200	unlike what
2985200	2985620	the doctors
2985620	2986260	say is good
2986260	2986620	for you
2986620	2990040	we don't
2990040	2990800	store hash
2990800	2991460	passwords in
2991460	2991660	new
2991660	2992860	password file
2992860	2993720	we store
2993720	2994180	salted
2994180	2994640	passwords
2994640	2996160	salted
2996160	2996580	means
2996580	2997940	at the
2997940	2998400	time of
2998400	2999020	the initial
2999020	3000120	creation of
3000120	3000460	a user
3000460	3000920	account
3000920	3002760	the system
3002760	3003100	or the
3003100	3003780	administrator
3003780	3004900	will pick
3004900	3005360	a random
3005360	3005800	number
3005800	3007140	called a
3007140	3007380	salt
3007380	3009240	that random
3009240	3009760	number is
3009760	3010220	only used
3010220	3010880	there in
3010880	3011240	the password
3011240	3011680	file
3011680	3013380	it isn't
3013380	3013880	stored in
3013880	3014180	the plain
3014180	3014480	text
3014480	3016700	but it's
3016700	3017960	not reused
3017960	3019100	so different
3019100	3019840	systems will
3019840	3020280	have different
3020280	3020900	salts for the
3020900	3021480	same user
3021480	3024980	so you
3024980	3025540	have a record
3025540	3026100	something that
3026100	3026620	looks something
3026620	3027180	like this
3027180	3028760	this is maybe
3028760	3029620	a little outdated
3029620	3030840	that green box
3030840	3031200	you see
3031200	3032560	gts would be my
3032560	3033280	account name
3033280	3035560	the salt will be
3035560	3036280	that number
3036280	3037220	right
3037220	3038560	the first blue
3038560	3038920	number
3038920	3040400	the second is
3040400	3041020	the hash
3041020	3042320	then you have
3042320	3042980	like user
3042980	3043540	identity
3043540	3044080	uid
3044080	3044880	i think that
3044880	3046020	the 14510 is
3046020	3046460	uid
3046460	3047500	30 i don't
3047500	3047640	remember
3047640	3048620	group id or
3048620	3048940	something
3048940	3049940	then the full
3049940	3050440	name
3050440	3051840	like what my
3051840	3052540	actual name is
3052540	3053180	and then the
3053180	3053860	login shell
3053860	3054620	right
3054620	3055800	and today is
3055800	3056320	probably like a
3056320	3056720	lot more
3056720	3058460	at least that
3058460	3059960	but we're not
3059960	3060520	interested in
3060520	3061380	the rest of the
3061380	3061680	stuff
3061680	3062300	the important
3062300	3062840	thing is
3062840	3063600	the salt
3063600	3063920	and the
3063920	3064340	password
3064340	3064840	that has
3064840	3065300	together
3065300	3067600	okay
3067600	3068180	so what
3068180	3068520	happens
3068520	3069400	very simple
3069400	3070880	little mandate
3070880	3071240	right
3071240	3071860	but makes a
3071860	3072420	big difference
3072420	3075440	that offline
3075440	3076560	attack
3076560	3077300	is no longer
3077300	3077800	possible
3077800	3082060	why not
3082060	3086460	well let me
3086460	3086820	give you an
3086820	3087080	example
3087080	3087680	suppose the
3087680	3088140	salt was
3088140	3089440	one decimal
3089440	3089800	digit
3089800	3093560	would the
3093560	3093900	offline
3093900	3094240	attack
3094240	3094400	be
3094400	3094760	possible
3094760	3099560	one
3099560	3099900	just one
3099900	3100200	decimal
3100200	3100440	digit
3100440	3100700	meaning
3100700	3101100	it's a
3101100	3101320	number
3101320	3101820	from zero
3101820	3102400	to ten
3102400	3104540	would it
3104540	3104880	be possible
3104880	3105300	to mount
3105300	3106140	this offline
3106140	3106500	attack
3106500	3108960	of course
3108960	3109520	it's possible
3109520	3110360	why not
3110360	3110700	right
3110700	3111880	just the work
3111880	3113000	increases tenfold
3113000	3115900	right
3115900	3116500	but okay
3116500	3117060	now it depends
3117060	3117640	on how long
3117640	3118440	exactly you make
3118440	3118560	it
3118560	3119060	but suppose
3119060	3119660	you make it
3119660	3121700	128 bits
3121700	3123700	oh
3123700	3124600	now
3124600	3125800	one digit
3125800	3126900	128 bits
3126900	3127620	instead of
3127620	3127980	like what
3127980	3128760	one digit
3128760	3129180	is like
3129180	3129720	three digits
3129720	3130660	right
3130660	3132040	so from three
3132040	3132820	bits to 128
3132820	3133120	bits
3133120	3133540	now the
3133540	3133840	adversary
3133840	3134600	cannot do
3134600	3135840	cannot do
3135840	3137100	an offline
3137100	3137500	attack
3137500	3138940	because remember
3138940	3139720	for every
3139720	3140300	guess of the
3140300	3140700	password
3140700	3142220	that the
3142220	3142580	adversary
3142580	3142980	makes
3142980	3145260	he has to
3145260	3145920	multiply
3145920	3146660	do it
3146660	3147600	two to the
3147600	3148560	128 times
3148560	3152400	per password
3152400	3154400	so it
3154400	3154760	will be
3154760	3155300	two to the
3155300	3156300	128 times
3156300	3156580	whatever
3156580	3157260	even two to
3157260	3157760	the 20
3157760	3158100	right
3158100	3158840	is
3158840	3160900	beyond reach
3160900	3161180	of the
3161180	3161540	adversary
3161540	3162160	today and
3162160	3162400	for
3162400	3162960	what it
3162960	3163380	would be
3163380	3166100	so originally
3166100	3166740	they made the
3166740	3166980	salt
3166980	3167640	32 bits
3167640	3168160	I'm not sure
3168160	3168720	exactly what
3168720	3168980	it is
3168980	3169340	because it
3169340	3169580	varies
3169580	3170040	I think the
3170040	3170440	length of the
3170440	3170940	salt varies
3170940	3171480	from unique
3171480	3172060	flavor
3172060	3172480	to unique
3172480	3172820	flavor
3172820	3174140	but if I
3174140	3174520	were using
3174520	3174880	it today
3174880	3175180	I would
3175180	3175500	want the
3175500	3175820	salt to
3175820	3176100	be at
3176100	3176360	least
3176360	3178420	80 but
3178420	3179180	probably
3179180	3179800	more like
3179800	3180260	128
3180260	3180840	than salt
3180840	3181100	is
3181100	3182660	healthier
3182660	3185100	okay
3185100	3185800	but salt
3185800	3186420	makes a big
3186420	3186800	difference
3186800	3187840	now once the
3187840	3188660	attacker breaks
3188660	3189020	in
3189020	3191200	okay
3191200	3192360	now there's a
3192360	3192980	crucial difference
3192980	3193660	between offline
3193660	3194240	and online
3194240	3194560	attack
3194560	3196320	once the
3196320	3196640	attacker
3196640	3197140	breaks in
3197140	3198400	and reads
3198400	3198640	the
3198640	3199360	lc password
3199360	3199740	file
3199740	3200120	okay
3200120	3201660	the attacker
3201660	3202120	sees the
3202120	3202320	salt
3202320	3204360	so then the
3204360	3204940	attack becomes
3204940	3205480	much cheaper
3205480	3207060	but it can
3207060	3207440	only be
3207440	3207820	mounted
3207820	3209200	once he
3209200	3210160	breaks in
3210160	3212200	not ahead
3212200	3215660	because
3215660	3216580	by knowing
3216580	3217100	the salt
3217100	3218180	you shave
3218180	3218600	off the
3218600	3218940	2 to the
3218940	3219280	128
3219280	3221400	okay
3221400	3225840	and that
3225840	3226280	basically
3226280	3227880	the explanation
3227880	3228280	is the same
3228280	3228480	thing
3228480	3231860	just take a
3231860	3232060	second
3232060	3232580	to read it
3232580	3235940	well you shave
3235940	3236260	off the
3236260	3236580	2 to the
3236580	3237140	number 28
3237140	3237660	but it's
3237660	3238260	no longer
3238260	3239400	only off
3239400	3239920	line
3239920	3240740	fully attack
3240740	3241820	no no
3241820	3242400	it's online
3242400	3243100	it's online
3243100	3243720	it's not
3243720	3244960	offline
3244960	3245360	at all
3245360	3246460	the attacker
3246460	3247080	breaks in
3247080	3247760	learns the
3247760	3247940	salt
3247940	3248300	and now
3248300	3248880	has to do
3248880	3249440	with that
3249440	3249780	salt
3249780	3251120	whatever
3251120	3251640	2 to the
3251640	3251980	20
3251980	3252500	2 to the
3252500	3252820	40
3252820	3253680	however many
3253680	3254080	password
3254080	3254420	guesses
3254420	3255400	there are
3255400	3256560	per user
3256560	3256920	yeah
3256920	3258860	so there's
3258860	3259240	still a bit
3259240	3259580	of work
3259580	3259900	but it's
3259900	3260320	not a scary
3260320	3260880	amount of work
3260880	3266080	I'm sorry
3266080	3267020	I mean
3267020	3267460	we can
3267460	3268100	let the salt
3268100	3268960	expire
3268960	3270340	well
3270340	3270820	you can
3270820	3271560	let the salt
3271560	3272380	expire
3272380	3273060	but you
3273060	3273420	have to
3273420	3274080	replace it
3274080	3274420	in the
3274420	3274840	password
3274840	3275260	file
3275260	3275940	so
3275940	3276900	what you're
3276900	3277200	saying
3277200	3277600	is that
3277600	3277960	you know
3277960	3278220	if you
3278220	3278520	know
3278520	3278740	that
3278740	3278900	they
3278900	3279140	have
3279140	3279280	the
3279280	3279360	so
3279360	3279460	it
3279460	3279740	takes
3279740	3280100	at least
3280100	3280540	24
3280540	3281000	hours
3281000	3282840	to
3282840	3283320	mount
3283320	3283520	an
3283520	3284120	online
3284120	3284520	attack
3284520	3284860	once
3284860	3285020	he
3285020	3285240	learns
3285240	3285480	the
3285480	3285740	salt
3285740	3287080	then
3287080	3287200	you
3287200	3287320	could
3287320	3287580	change
3287580	3287760	the
3287760	3287980	salt
3287980	3288240	every
3288240	3288660	24
3288660	3288900	hour
3288900	3290560	you could
3290560	3291760	but the
3291760	3292440	problem is
3292440	3294940	okay
3294940	3296380	so this is a good question
3296380	3298480	let's think about this
3298480	3302640	that what you say
3302640	3303980	would be useful
3303980	3304640	or would be
3304640	3305340	possible
3305340	3306140	if
3306140	3307560	just
3307560	3308760	a password
3308760	3309180	attack
3309180	3309780	a brute force
3309780	3310160	password
3310160	3310580	attack
3310580	3311040	would take
3311040	3311420	24
3311420	3311760	hours
3311760	3313420	but remember
3313420	3314240	once the adversary
3314240	3314840	breaks in
3314840	3315360	and learns
3315360	3315900	the salt
3315900	3318160	he then
3318160	3319960	also knows
3319960	3321060	the hash of the salt
3321060	3321660	and the password
3321660	3322020	right
3322020	3322780	so the adversary
3322780	3323580	knows this
3323580	3323840	right
3323840	3324100	that
3324100	3325020	the
3325020	3327260	well
3327260	3327680	that
3327680	3334000	the adversary
3334000	3334860	knows this
3334860	3335860	right
3335860	3337400	once he breaks in
3337400	3338000	he knows this
3338000	3339360	and he also knows
3339360	3339820	the salt
3339820	3343080	so you can change
3343080	3343620	the salt
3343620	3346060	but he learned
3346060	3347180	the previous salt
3347180	3347820	and the hash
3347820	3348740	of the previous salt
3348740	3349400	plus password
3349400	3351420	he's gonna break
3351420	3351920	the password
3351920	3353760	see
3353760	3355580	he's gonna break
3355580	3355940	the password
3355940	3357720	so changing the salt
3357720	3358380	at that point
3358380	3359720	not effective
3359720	3361480	not effective
3361480	3362880	because
3362880	3364100	if he's breaking
3364100	3364660	it locally
3364660	3365020	maybe
3365020	3365320	but
3365320	3365780	you know
3365780	3366100	others
3366100	3366440	he's gonna
3366440	3367020	exfiltrate
3367020	3367520	and break
3367520	3368020	it on his own
3368020	3368340	path
3368340	3369100	so
3369100	3369820	the password
3369820	3370460	hasn't changed
3370460	3371040	that's the main
3371040	3371440	problem
3371440	3375240	but here
3375240	3375700	it says
3375700	3377520	12
3377520	3378200	I think
3378200	3379060	I may be wrong
3379060	3379360	it wasn't
3379360	3379580	30
3379580	3380240	I think
3380240	3380660	it was even
3380660	3381280	less
3381280	3381760	it was 12
3381760	3382080	bits
3382080	3382620	originally
3382620	3383580	well today
3383580	3384000	12 bits
3384000	3384520	is laughable
3384520	3384740	right
3384740	3385160	so what
3385160	3385440	is it
3385440	3385720	saying
3385720	3386400	if the
3386400	3386720	passwords
3386720	3387200	come from
3387200	3387420	I don't
3387420	3387560	know
3387560	3388060	2 to the
3388060	3388340	20
3388340	3388800	space
3388800	3389660	and multiplied
3389660	3390300	by 2 to the
3390300	3390560	12
3390560	3390920	you still
3390920	3391380	get 2 to
3391380	3391720	32
3391720	3392640	which is
3392640	3393100	a laughably
3393100	3393760	small number
3393760	3394780	or password
3394780	3395140	bracket
3395140	3396840	right
3396840	3397340	it takes
3397340	3398760	a minute
3398760	3399180	or less
3399180	3400620	to go for
3400620	3401080	the 2 to the
3401080	3401460	32
3401460	3402380	password
3402380	3402680	choice
3402680	3405860	right
3405860	3406140	so
3406140	3407080	instead
3407080	3407700	so
3407700	3408640	what happens
3408640	3409680	these days
3409680	3410020	is that
3410020	3410600	most systems
3410600	3411020	actually
3411020	3412260	kind of
3412260	3412680	separate
3412680	3413000	the two
3413000	3413220	things
3413220	3413640	they separate
3413640	3414380	the password
3414380	3415960	from
3415960	3417520	the account
3417520	3418080	information
3418080	3418620	in Unix
3418620	3419040	and that's
3419040	3419240	kind of
3419240	3419460	a good
3419460	3419840	practice
3419840	3420280	anyway
3420280	3421880	so
3421880	3423000	they create
3423000	3423320	what's called
3423320	3423700	shadow
3423700	3424180	password
3424180	3425000	and so
3425000	3425800	instead of
3425800	3426280	looking like
3426280	3426800	what you saw
3426800	3427320	before
3427320	3428380	the account
3428380	3429100	record
3429100	3429540	in the
3429540	3429800	etsy
3429800	3430260	password
3430260	3430720	file
3430720	3432620	has
3432620	3433820	the name
3433820	3434760	and then
3434760	3435220	all the other
3435220	3435780	information
3435780	3436180	but there's
3436180	3436520	like an
3436520	3436920	x
3436920	3438180	following the
3438180	3438700	accounting
3438700	3439200	that says
3439200	3440000	actual password
3440000	3440540	isn't here
3440540	3441660	it's a
3441660	3443120	special
3443120	3444260	hashed
3444260	3444920	password file
3444920	3445520	which is not
3445520	3446180	world readable
3446180	3448280	like it took
3448280	3449400	only 30 years
3449400	3450140	for people to realize
3450140	3451340	that the passwords
3451340	3452300	and user account
3452300	3452780	information
3452780	3453500	shouldn't be stored
3453500	3453940	together
3453940	3456760	well that's what
3456760	3457100	happens
3457100	3457340	right
3457340	3458880	because all
3458880	3459280	those other
3459280	3459700	programs
3459700	3460700	application programs
3460700	3461180	running on
3461180	3461800	this Unix
3461800	3462400	like operating
3462400	3462740	system
3462740	3463680	they still
3463680	3464120	do need
3464120	3464580	the account
3464580	3465120	information
3465120	3466040	to figure out
3466040	3466600	who can access
3466600	3466980	what
3466980	3467280	etc
3467280	3468280	and distinguish
3468280	3468920	between users
3468920	3469300	but
3469300	3471160	they don't
3471160	3471480	need to know
3471480	3471940	the passwords
3471940	3473300	right
3473300	3473660	so
3473660	3475900	let's create
3475900	3476620	a file
3476620	3477160	that has
3477160	3477800	all the account
3477800	3478240	information
3478240	3478880	that also
3478880	3479480	store passwords
3479480	3479700	in
3479700	3480160	passwords
3480160	3480600	should only
3480600	3481000	be visible
3481000	3481580	to the root
3481580	3482220	or the admin
3482220	3482600	account
3482600	3483540	right
3483540	3484020	so instead
3484020	3484500	it's stored
3484500	3485080	in an etsy
3485080	3485900	shadow file
3485900	3486840	which is only
3486840	3487160	readable
3487160	3487620	by the
3487620	3487940	system
3487940	3488420	administrator
3488420	3490640	okay
3490640	3492740	also
3492740	3493480	very trivial
3493480	3493860	thing
3493860	3495040	and of course
3495040	3495360	it also
3495360	3496180	added expiration
3496180	3496420	date
3496420	3496940	for passwords
3496940	3497220	right
3497220	3497580	so that's
3497580	3498500	why on
3498500	3499620	most
3499620	3500400	production
3500400	3501200	Unix
3501200	3501780	like systems
3501780	3502200	you'll be
3502200	3502540	asked to
3502540	3502860	renew
3502860	3503960	or
3503960	3505960	change
3505960	3506200	another
3506200	3506540	password
3506540	3507000	every so
3507000	3507200	often
3507200	3510300	okay
3510300	3510760	so
3510760	3511420	you've probably
3511420	3511820	heard of
3511820	3512320	keyloggers
3512320	3512580	right
3512580	3515700	so these
3515700	3516120	are things
3516120	3516600	you generally
3516600	3517060	have to be
3517060	3517740	afraid of
3517740	3519980	not so much
3519980	3520480	on your own
3520480	3520980	devices
3520980	3521580	because
3521580	3522300	it's not
3522300	3522780	all that
3522780	3523100	easy
3523100	3523680	to install
3523680	3524220	a keylogger
3524220	3524480	unless
3524480	3524820	somebody
3524820	3525000	has
3525000	3525760	direct
3525760	3526380	access
3526380	3526760	and an
3526760	3527100	account
3527100	3527420	on your
3527420	3527820	device
3527820	3528360	but
3528360	3528880	more like
3528880	3529180	when you're
3529180	3529400	using
3529400	3529880	public
3529880	3531500	facility
3531500	3531980	like
3531980	3532460	any of
3532460	3532700	you ever
3532700	3532960	use
3532960	3533500	ICS
3533500	3534060	terminals
3534060	3535500	or ICS
3535500	3535860	machines
3535860	3536420	but that's
3536420	3536680	where you
3536680	3536920	have to
3536920	3537280	be worried
3537280	3537720	about
3537720	3538280	because
3538280	3541420	there you
3541420	3541720	have no
3541720	3542020	idea
3542020	3543380	what software
3543380	3543880	is running
3543880	3544420	who has
3544420	3544780	been there
3544780	3545080	before
3545080	3545260	you
3545260	3545560	essentially
3545560	3546180	these
3546180	3546540	machines
3546540	3546740	are
3546740	3548500	sort of
3548500	3548620	like
3548620	3548960	public
3548960	3549280	toilet
3549280	3549860	you have
3549860	3550380	no idea
3550380	3550900	what's
3550900	3551300	going on
3551300	3551540	there
3551540	3552460	and
3552460	3552660	what
3552660	3552800	is
3552800	3553040	running
3553040	3553260	there
3553260	3553500	really
3553500	3555880	so
3555880	3556020	if
3556020	3556180	these
3556180	3556660	drugloggers
3556660	3556900	are
3556900	3557440	problem
3557440	3558580	they
3558580	3559080	can be
3559080	3559520	hardware
3559520	3559880	based
3559880	3560020	or
3560020	3560580	software
3560580	3561020	based
3561020	3561860	hardware
3561860	3562160	based
3562160	3562380	means
3562380	3562640	somebody
3562640	3563080	actually
3563080	3564200	inserted
3564200	3565860	something
3565860	3567240	you
3567240	3567400	know
3567400	3567960	external
3567960	3568400	keyboards
3568400	3568760	not the
3568760	3568920	kind
3568920	3569200	you have
3569200	3569560	right now
3569560	3569840	in front
3569840	3570000	of you
3570000	3570160	but
3570160	3570560	actual
3570560	3571100	keyboards
3571100	3571860	move on
3571860	3572580	they have
3572580	3572920	a wire
3572920	3575180	some of them
3575180	3575340	do
3575340	3575700	some of them
3575700	3575920	don't
3575920	3576300	but most
3576300	3576800	have a wire
3576800	3578520	well
3578520	3579460	the wire
3579460	3580000	goes in the
3580000	3580400	back of the
3580400	3580680	computer
3580680	3581040	somewhere
3581040	3581380	or
3581380	3581920	some
3581920	3582900	USB
3582900	3583940	interface
3583940	3584860	well
3584860	3585300	somebody
3585300	3585560	could have
3585560	3586360	installed
3586360	3586700	something
3586700	3586980	between
3586980	3587460	the USB
3587460	3588000	interface
3588000	3588240	and the
3588240	3588420	back
3588420	3588620	of the
3588620	3588840	computer
3588840	3589280	you cannot
3589280	3589560	see
3589560	3590020	especially
3590020	3590420	publicly
3590420	3592380	and
3592380	3593380	essentially
3593380	3594440	it
3594440	3594900	sees
3594900	3595200	every
3595200	3595600	keystroke
3595600	3595920	you have
3595920	3598260	okay
3598260	3599460	some
3599460	3599820	government
3599820	3600320	computers
3600320	3601520	in various
3601520	3601940	agencies
3601940	3602500	do this
3602500	3603060	on purpose
3603060	3603620	they tell
3603620	3604060	employees
3604060	3604660	your
3604660	3606020	keystrokes
3606020	3606440	are locked
3606440	3606700	and there's
3606700	3607260	a keylogger
3607260	3608100	for
3608100	3608820	auditability
3608820	3609260	and logging
3609260	3609660	purposes
3609660	3611500	but
3611500	3612400	do you
3612400	3613060	yourself
3613060	3613620	whenever
3613620	3614160	you use
3614160	3614700	a public
3614700	3615440	or at least
3615440	3615980	not personal
3615980	3616400	but do you
3616400	3616840	have a look
3616840	3617940	to see
3617940	3618400	that the
3618400	3618740	wire
3618740	3619540	goes directly
3619540	3619860	into the
3619860	3620440	USB port
3620440	3620640	in the
3620640	3620860	back
3620860	3621060	of the
3621060	3621360	computer
3621360	3622200	or
3622200	3622460	there's
3622460	3622660	some
3622660	3622900	other
3622900	3623460	little
3623460	3623800	creepy
3623800	3624280	crawling
3624280	3624640	that
3624640	3624900	is in
3624900	3625260	between
3625260	3626740	I bet
3626740	3627120	most people
3627120	3627540	don't
3627540	3629320	with
3629320	3629960	wireless
3629960	3631580	oh
3631580	3632100	with wireless
3632100	3632820	it's even worse
3632820	3634200	because the
3634200	3634560	wireless
3634560	3635040	keyboard
3635040	3635640	typically
3635640	3636000	use
3636000	3636500	encryption
3636500	3637900	but the
3637900	3638180	kind of
3638180	3638480	encryption
3638480	3638800	you use
3638800	3639140	is often
3639140	3639820	homegrown
3639820	3640180	by the
3640180	3640660	manufacturer
3640660	3641060	or really
3641060	3641400	crappy
3641400	3643540	and so
3643540	3644500	you don't
3644500	3644840	need to
3644840	3645440	put a
3645440	3645760	hardware
3645760	3646280	device
3646280	3647580	you can
3647580	3648160	just sniff
3648160	3648680	on it
3648680	3649680	externally
3649680	3651060	right
3651060	3651340	because
3651340	3651700	they use
3651700	3651880	some
3651880	3652160	kind of
3652160	3653320	either
3653320	3653820	infrared
3653820	3654140	or some
3654140	3654320	other
3654320	3654460	kind
3654460	3654620	of
3654620	3655100	wireless
3655100	3659420	so
3659420	3660000	beware
3660000	3662000	but
3662000	3662760	attacks
3662760	3663660	keylogger
3663660	3664020	attacks
3664020	3664420	especially
3664420	3664920	hardware ones
3664920	3665160	are not
3665160	3665380	common
3665380	3665660	they are
3665660	3666100	targeted
3666100	3666420	right
3666420	3666740	somebody
3666740	3667000	has to
3667000	3667260	target
3667260	3667780	a specific
3667780	3668140	computer
3668140	3668560	a specific
3668560	3668980	person
3668980	3669640	in order
3669640	3669920	to do
3669920	3670100	that
3670100	3670820	software
3670820	3671340	keyloggers
3671340	3671780	are different
3671780	3673040	that often
3673040	3673420	happens
3673420	3674620	with buggy
3674620	3675200	browsers
3675200	3678540	or buggy
3678540	3679000	it used
3679000	3679340	to happen
3679340	3679840	once in
3679840	3680120	a while
3680120	3680720	with microsoft
3680720	3681240	windows
3681240	3682320	where there
3682320	3682580	would be
3682580	3683140	some malware
3683140	3683560	that would
3683560	3684320	warm itself
3684320	3684980	and usually
3684980	3685340	again
3685340	3685700	with some
3685700	3686080	degree of
3686080	3686840	social engineering
3686840	3687620	preceding it
3687620	3688660	and then
3688660	3689380	will
3689380	3689700	install
3689700	3689940	itself
3689940	3690320	and actually
3690320	3691100	take over
3691100	3692140	the keyboard
3692140	3693360	driver
3693360	3695220	or worse
3695220	3695400	yet
3695400	3695860	update
3695860	3696420	the keyboard
3696420	3696820	driver
3696820	3697080	right
3697080	3697300	because
3697300	3697740	the keyboard
3697740	3698080	is a
3698080	3698400	peripheral
3698400	3699140	right
3699140	3699800	there's a
3699800	3700100	driver
3700100	3700500	for that
3700500	3700900	peripheral
3700900	3701460	to
3701460	3702360	insert an
3702360	3703000	illegitimate
3703000	3703820	fake update
3703820	3704180	of the
3704180	3704540	driver
3705200	3706000	that would
3706000	3706340	contain
3706340	3707000	a keylogger
3707000	3708300	not nice
3708300	3709320	and then
3709320	3709700	there are
3709700	3710120	like
3710120	3710800	lower tech
3710800	3711480	ways of
3711480	3712000	sniffing
3712000	3712400	on
3712400	3713760	keyboard
3713760	3714260	input
3714260	3715320	shoulder
3715320	3715760	surfing
3715760	3717480	everybody
3717480	3717880	familiar
3717880	3718100	with
3718100	3718320	shoulder
3718320	3718640	surfing
3718640	3720260	yeah
3720260	3720700	people are
3720700	3720880	getting
3720880	3721380	too close
3721380	3722180	to you
3722180	3723100	too close
3723100	3723600	for comfort
3723600	3724960	you're entering
3724960	3725520	your pen
3725520	3726220	whether it's
3726220	3726500	on the
3726500	3726900	door
3726900	3727500	block
3727500	3727900	or
3727900	3728660	on your
3728660	3728940	bank
3728940	3729420	ATM
3729420	3729940	somebody's
3729940	3730080	like
3730080	3730380	breathing
3730380	3730680	down
3730680	3731120	your neck
3731120	3732220	that's
3732220	3732440	shoulder
3732440	3732800	surfing
3732800	3734520	I mean
3734520	3735040	easy to
3735040	3735440	avoid
3735440	3737400	but you have
3737400	3737580	to be
3737580	3737820	coming
3737820	3738100	center
3738100	3738400	right
3738400	3739140	but
3739140	3739380	shoulder
3739380	3739680	surfing
3739680	3740160	means that
3740160	3740460	human
3740460	3742700	eyes are
3742700	3742920	looking
3742920	3743260	at something
3743260	3743760	but it's not
3743760	3744240	always human
3744240	3744560	eyes
3744560	3745500	it could be
3745500	3746340	a tiny little
3746340	3746740	drone
3746740	3748200	it could be
3748200	3748700	a camera
3748700	3750300	from farther
3750300	3750680	away
3750680	3751000	with a
3751000	3751500	telephoto
3751500	3751840	lens
3751840	3753460	that is
3753460	3754720	shoulder
3754720	3755180	surfing
3755180	3756420	right
3756420	3757280	so
3757280	3758080	it could be
3758080	3758680	think about
3758680	3758800	it
3758800	3759420	you go
3759420	3759960	let's

3839600	3840240	boom
3840240	3841360	well
3841360	3841640	that's
3841640	3842060	the force
3842060	3842380	right
3842380	3844320	that generates
3844320	3844600	heat
3844600	3844940	cut off

3854020	3854400	somebody
3854400	3854980	snaps

3858300	3859340	they
3859340	3859540	will

3859940	3860920	heat
3860920	3861160	map
3861160	3862900	they

3864240	3864460	that
3864460	3864680	won't
3864680	3864980	press
3864980	3865460	most
3865460	3865840	recently
3865840	3867180	they
3867180	3867480	might
3867480	3867860	not
3867860	3868520	directly
3868520	3869060	leak
3869060	3869740	pin
3869740	3870000	or
3870000	3870260	password
3870260	3870820	information
3870820	3871660	but
3871660	3871860	it
3871860	3872140	leaks
3872140	3872560	a lot
3872560	3873100	information
3873100	3873360	that's
3873360	3873640	about
3873640	3875180	in
3875180	3875680	particular
3875680	3876120	which
3876120	3876320	keys
3876320	3876480	were
3876480	3876720	pressed
3876720	3877080	recently
3877080	3877320	maybe
3877320	3877520	not
3877520	3877880	exactly
3877880	3878080	the
3878080	3878400	sequence
3878400	3878920	but
3878920	3879220	how many
3879220	3879600	combinations
3879600	3879880	that
3879880	3879940	are
3879940	3880760	right
3880760	3881760	so
3881760	3884460	something to worry about
3884460	3887560	then there is something called acoustic emanation
3887560	3890020	there's a whole body of research literature on this
3890020	3892240	starting in like 25 years ago
3892240	3893480	people realize
3893480	3896680	people realize
3896680	3900500	that when you type on any surface
3900500	3901500	be it a keyboard
3901500	3901860	or a
3901860	3902040	thing
3902040	3904580	even on the phone
3904580	3905400	on the
3905400	3906620	on screen keyboard
3906620	3908820	there are sounds that are being named
3908820	3911680	and sound propagates
3911680	3912180	right
3912180	3913980	when you type
3913980	3915200	especially in some of those
3915200	3916040	people like me
3916040	3916300	etc
3916300	3916940	aggressive
3916940	3917340	times
3917340	3920140	sound propagates
3920140	3920540	farther
3920540	3922480	than the human ears
3922480	3922760	right
3922760	3925440	so if you put a very sensitive microphone
3925440	3926800	you know
3926800	3927840	ten yards away
3927840	3929100	people still pick up
3929100	3930500	keyboard emanations
3930500	3932660	isn't that scary
3932660	3935180	I think it's very cool
3935180	3936900	I have a lot of research on this
3936900	3939220	still these days
3939220	3940300	there are people who work at it
3940300	3940500	but
3940500	3942100	the sound
3942100	3943500	that your
3943500	3945140	fingers make
3945140	3946380	when you type in
3946380	3947100	anything
3947100	3948400	not just the classroom
3948400	3950100	is unique
3950100	3952000	not because
3952000	3952460	so much
3952460	3953420	that you make it
3953420	3955060	but the keyboard
3955060	3955520	itself
3955520	3958000	produces a different sound
3958000	3960620	for any different key
3960620	3962680	every key
3962680	3963800	on your plastic keyboard
3963800	3967060	makes a different sound
3967060	3967540	the same
3967540	3968740	to a lesser extent
3968740	3970020	old story about the keyboard
3970020	3970420	you have
3970420	3972760	but every time you press a key
3972760	3975060	the sound that it makes
3975060	3975800	when you press a Z
3975800	3976720	is different from the sound
3976720	3977280	that it makes you
3977280	3978040	when you press a D
3978040	3979060	or slash
3979060	3980140	or a question mark
3980140	3980640	or space
3980640	3981160	okay
3981160	3982420	there are different sounds
3982420	3984600	and so
3984600	3985880	if I record those sounds
3985880	3987260	I essentially can key log
3987260	3989500	without installing a key log
3989500	3992020	isn't that fun
3992020	3994620	but it gets worse
3994620	3996880	much worse
3996880	3999680	even if the manufacturers
3999680	4000820	and some made an effort
4000820	4001500	some didn't
4001500	4003220	to make all the keyboard
4003220	4004240	sounds sound the same
4004240	4006200	it's possible
4006200	4007640	it makes people
4007640	4008380	more expensive
4008380	4011540	there's still a problem
4011540	4012900	does anybody see the problem?
4018700	4020020	yourself as a person
4020020	4021480	what about yourself?
4021700	4022060	I mean
4022060	4023380	some people
4023380	4025280	have just
4025280	4026080	and they find
4026080	4026660	and they just
4026660	4027700	make themselves
4027700	4029280	because of the finger
4029280	4029640	and
4029640	4030080	uh-huh
4030080	4030960	yeah
4030960	4031240	yeah
4031240	4031940	so remember
4031940	4033440	it's true
4033440	4034080	that
4034080	4034980	what I said before
4034980	4036020	is that there's you
4036020	4037820	who types differently
4037820	4039140	depending on which key you type
4039140	4041420	and then there's the actual keyboard
4041420	4042500	that makes different sounds
4042500	4043480	so even if you press
4043480	4044640	the same way
4044640	4045320	on the same
4045320	4046120	like
4046120	4048320	you have this finger
4048320	4049080	like you're one of those
4049080	4049780	hunter tech
4049780	4051160	people like me
4051160	4052300	like
4052300	4053420	you move the keyboard
4053420	4055980	hit
4055980	4056940	move the keyboard
4056940	4057320	hit it
4057320	4057720	so you see
4057720	4058980	my angle doesn't change
4058980	4061040	so I hit the same way
4061040	4062000	right
4062000	4063400	but the keyboard sound
4063400	4063880	is different
4063880	4065840	but
4065840	4067860	manufacturers suppose
4067860	4068820	now fix the keyboard
4068820	4069620	that all the sounds
4069620	4070100	are the same
4070100	4071920	but I haven't changed
4071920	4072220	right
4072220	4073300	so
4073300	4074280	when I use my
4074280	4075780	this finger
4075780	4077840	that goes straight down
4077840	4078920	on this one letter
4078920	4079900	it sounds one way
4079900	4081600	when I have to angle my finger
4081600	4082920	to press shift
4082920	4084000	right
4084000	4085680	or press question mark
4085680	4086680	it sounds differently
4086680	4087920	not because of the keyboard
4087920	4089220	but because of the way
4089220	4090720	I angle my fingers
4090720	4091820	and the force I apply
4091820	4092720	correct
4092720	4094580	but it gets worse than that
4094580	4096540	that
4096540	4096880	so
4096880	4097800	you can indeed
4097800	4098940	still mine the information
4098940	4099380	like I said
4099380	4100740	about the individual
4100740	4102080	humans typing
4102080	4103040	characteristics
4103040	4103520	but
4103520	4104560	it's harder
4104560	4105380	it's harder
4105380	4106340	it's easier to extract
4106340	4107180	from the manufacturer
4107180	4107780	introduced
4107780	4108560	distinction
4108560	4109360	though
4109360	4110100	the problem is
4110100	4110960	what did you say
4110960	4111320	time
4111320	4112340	like time between keys
4112340	4113160	time between keys
4113160	4113900	that's the problem
4113900	4115200	turns out
4115200	4116120	on a standard
4116120	4117240	QWERTY keyboard
4117240	4117880	let's assume
4117880	4118920	that we're using
4118920	4119560	QWERTYs
4119560	4119800	right
4119800	4120540	which is an American
4120540	4121060	keyboard
4121060	4124480	as you move
4124480	4125680	from key to key
4125680	4127740	right
4127740	4129720	from let's say
4129720	4130340	typing key
4130340	4131180	to typing H
4131180	4131940	to typing E
4131940	4132800	to typing N
4132800	4133500	to typing E
4133500	4134280	to typing X
4134280	4135060	to typing E
4135060	4137000	right
4137000	4137960	you type one letter
4137960	4138420	at a time
4138420	4139120	even if you are
4139120	4139680	touch typist
4139680	4140580	you type one letter
4140580	4141100	at a time
4141100	4141700	well
4141700	4143080	the intervals
4143080	4144060	the timing intervals
4144060	4145660	between successive letters
4145660	4147340	are unique to you
4147340	4148160	also
4148160	4149420	and the keyboard
4149420	4150180	they sound like
4150180	4150660	that's right
4150660	4151740	they're slightly different
4151740	4152000	yeah
4152000	4152460	yeah
4152460	4152800	but
4152800	4153680	that's right
4153680	4154940	they sound
4154940	4155560	that's true
4155560	4156180	but that's actually
4156180	4156980	related more
4156980	4157600	to what he said
4157600	4159100	but just
4159100	4160420	the sheer timings
4160420	4161600	between the keystrokes
4161600	4163640	so you don't have
4163640	4164620	to have any idea
4164620	4164980	but
4164980	4166380	guess what
4166380	4166940	there are
4166940	4167620	let's say
4167620	4168600	forget the
4168600	4169500	exclamation points
4169500	4170000	forget those
4170000	4170660	special characters
4170660	4171280	let's suppose
4171280	4171620	there are
4171620	4172100	I don't know
4172100	4173100	26 keys
4173100	4173580	on the keyboard
4173580	4174880	and you're just
4174880	4175960	typing words
4175960	4176260	right
4176260	4178520	so how many
4178520	4178960	possible
4178960	4179520	two word
4179520	4180060	combinations
4180060	4180480	are there
4180480	4180880	two letter
4180880	4181220	combinations
4181220	4181500	are there
4181500	4182420	26 times 26
4182420	4182800	right
4182800	4184560	so after a while
4184560	4184920	if you
4184920	4186340	record
4186340	4187260	the sounds
4187260	4187680	of somebody
4187680	4188080	typing
4188080	4189020	a lot of text
4189020	4189280	right
4189280	4189980	over the day
4189980	4190740	or two days
4190740	4191140	or whatever
4191140	4192100	you're going to
4192100	4193040	start distinguishing
4193040	4194500	between transitions
4194500	4195320	between keys
4195320	4195720	right
4195720	4199040	believe me
4199040	4199940	it's totally doable
4199940	4201660	because
4201660	4203000	assuming
4203000	4203460	somebody
4203460	4203980	is typing
4203980	4204920	English text
4204920	4205240	right
4205240	4205820	like writing
4205820	4206700	email messages
4206700	4207900	or filling out
4207900	4208420	forms
4208420	4209460	well
4209460	4211420	the probability
4211420	4212120	of occurrence
4212120	4213260	of two successive
4213260	4214220	letters
4214220	4215820	are quite distinct
4215820	4217000	and essentially
4217000	4217400	becomes
4217400	4218460	a simple
4218460	4218740	decision
4218740	4219840	so anyway
4219840	4220460	that was a little
4220460	4220920	detour
4220920	4221700	but what about
4221700	4222420	good vibrations
4222420	4223400	well good vibrations
4223400	4224240	refers to another
4224240	4224680	thing that
4224680	4225480	actually
4225480	4226680	if you're using
4226680	4227220	your phone
4227220	4227980	and that has
4227980	4228480	been some
4228480	4229260	published research
4229260	4229620	on this
4229620	4231280	and your phone
4231280	4231840	is like this
4231840	4232480	on your
4232480	4234060	desk
4234060	4235000	or whatever
4235000	4235820	in front of you
4235820	4236040	right
4236040	4236720	and
4236720	4238040	as you press
4238040	4238600	every
4238600	4239840	on-screen
4239840	4240560	button
4240560	4240820	right
4240820	4241560	on-screen keyboard
4241560	4242780	your phone
4242780	4243420	makes like a tiny
4243420	4244200	vibration sound
4244200	4245840	like a moment
4245840	4246340	that the other
4246340	4246840	phone do
4246840	4247120	right
4247120	4248380	just to confirm
4248380	4248880	that you actually
4248880	4249520	type
4249520	4250680	well
4250680	4253260	those vibrations
4253260	4254520	when you put a
4254520	4254880	microphone
4254880	4255520	underneath your
4255520	4255960	desk
4255960	4256720	they can actually
4256720	4257480	calculate your
4257480	4257740	typing
4257740	4262400	other analysis
4262400	4263180	include taking
4263180	4263800	photos of
4263800	4264900	smartphone screens
4264900	4266340	and looking for
4266340	4267820	quadrants
4267820	4268540	little areas
4268540	4269240	on your screen
4269240	4270500	that are
4270500	4271300	most
4271300	4272480	like smudged
4272480	4274840	that
4274840	4275900	leaks information
4275900	4276640	about your
4276640	4277700	password
4277700	4278980	or the
4278980	4279800	unlock pattern
4279800	4280100	you know
4280100	4280300	this
4280300	4280700	like
4280700	4281580	anybody use
4281580	4282160	unlock patterns
4282160	4283980	like five years
4283980	4284200	ago
4284200	4285600	everybody in this
4285600	4285880	class
4285880	4286220	was like
4286220	4286580	yes
4286580	4287740	I guess
4287740	4287980	they are
4287980	4288580	faster now
4288580	4289840	but apparently
4289840	4290440	you know
4290440	4291380	if your human
4291380	4292760	fingers leave
4292760	4293400	like oil
4293400	4294400	residue
4294400	4295180	on the screen
4295180	4296340	and so
4296340	4296980	if you take
4296980	4297600	a high resolution
4297600	4298160	photo of
4298160	4298580	somebody's
4298580	4299480	smartphone screen
4299480	4300660	you've got to
4300660	4301080	figure out
4301080	4301440	what the
4301440	4302060	unlock pattern
4302060	4302340	is
4302340	4304880	yeah
4304880	4306220	so all this
4306220	4306880	is good stuff
4306880	4308420	but the problem
4308420	4309020	is of course
4309020	4309440	like that
4309440	4309960	the passwords
4309960	4311340	right
4311340	4311720	why do I
4311720	4312260	talk about
4312260	4312660	all this
4312660	4313120	previous stuff
4313120	4313780	because that
4313780	4314080	would be
4314080	4314740	not only just
4314740	4315180	a way of
4315180	4315800	snoop on
4315800	4316140	what you're
4316140	4316400	doing
4316400	4316880	but of course
4316880	4317380	to snoop on
4317380	4317820	your passwords
4317820	4318740	right
4318740	4319240	that's the way
4319240	4319640	to actually
4319640	4320660	and sort of
4320660	4321080	learn your
4321080	4321360	password
4321360	4322780	the worst
4322780	4323480	thing we can
4323480	4324020	do is write
4324020	4324480	them down
4324480	4325260	because then
4325260	4326520	writing them
4326520	4326800	down
4326800	4327780	whether it's
4327780	4328780	on a device
4328780	4329300	or a piece
4329300	4329660	of paper
4329660	4330300	that becomes
4330300	4331980	a way to
4331980	4332500	like cause
4332500	4332900	denial of
4332900	4333200	service
4333200	4333540	etc
4333540	4334820	we can
4334820	4335400	pick passwords
4335400	4335660	that are
4335660	4335980	easy to
4335980	4336460	remember
4336460	4340480	some places
4340480	4340920	don't even
4340920	4341580	have passwords
4341580	4342080	I've seen
4342080	4342640	a few
4342640	4343640	systems
4343640	4344140	websites
4344140	4344660	which
4344660	4345300	completely
4345300	4345740	have no
4345740	4346080	passwords
4346080	4346540	but instead
4346540	4347100	have these
4347100	4347720	special
4347720	4348300	questions
4348300	4349120	like
4349120	4349720	they give
4349720	4350120	you five
4350120	4350480	special
4350480	4350920	questions
4350920	4351320	every time
4351320	4351620	you want to
4351620	4351900	log in
4351900	4352220	you have to
4352220	4352720	answer four
4352720	4353080	out of five
4353080	4353340	friends
4353340	4354380	but they all
4354380	4354760	tend to be
4354760	4355000	of this
4355000	4355380	variety
4355380	4356040	what's your
4356040	4356580	favorite pet's
4356580	4356780	name
4356780	4357980	rover
4357980	4358520	bio
4358520	4359920	jerry
4359920	4361780	and they
4361780	4362120	give you
4362120	4362940	some of
4362940	4363200	them are
4363200	4363460	worse
4363460	4363900	than others
4363900	4364320	some of
4364320	4364600	them allow
4364600	4364980	you free
4364980	4365580	text entry
4365580	4366660	which is
4366660	4366940	better
4366940	4367300	and some
4367300	4367580	of them
4367580	4368000	give you
4368000	4368480	a choice
4368480	4369880	like
4369880	4370100	out of
4370100	4370560	these five
4370560	4371000	pet names
4371000	4371360	which one
4371360	4371660	is your
4371660	4371940	favorite
4371940	4372980	really
4372980	4373500	seriously
4373500	4374720	terrible
4374720	4377200	easily
4377200	4377700	guessable
4377700	4378180	alright
4378180	4378540	I think
4378540	4378880	we should
4378880	4379100	be
4379100	4380240	done
4380240	4380640	for today
4380640	4380900	yeah
4380900	4381160	I'll
4381160	4381400	forget
4381400	4381620	this
4381620	4382160	candle
4382160	4382520	to me
4382520	4383920	ok
