1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's the MCM syndrome that I recommend, it's, you know, tells you everything you want to know about spam.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And surprisingly, 20 years, not many things change about spam.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But, so why the parallel? Well, spam is annoying, right? This spam.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And so is the email spam or electronic spam. So that's where the analogy comes from.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I do some stats. I didn't, like, double check them, but I think they're reasonably accurate.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, number of, like, email versus spam, right?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So you see the bars, the total bars represent total email spam.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The red part is the percentage of spam. I'm sorry. Total email, percentage of spam.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
From this six-year period, ending in 2022, my guess is it hasn't changed very much.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It probably continued along the same line up to 20, 25.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Interestingly, more spam was sent as a percentage of all emails, like, six years ago.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then it kind of sort of levels off, you know, right?

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But it's still impressive, right? If you haven't seen this, it is impressive.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Email is still, right? Maybe not so much, you think, for your generation because you've never really worked outside.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Or many of you haven't really worked in real jobs.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But once you get a real job, yes, people use Slack and, you know, some other versions thereof and wikis and God knows what else.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But email is still there and it has no signs of going away.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So I predict email is not going to go away for at least a decade.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's for the time it is here to stay.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, an enlarged percentage of it is spam.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Spam is not only email-based.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You may have received robocalls, right? That's spam.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's just another version of spam.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Text messages? Yes? Text?

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A lot of SMS.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Sometimes WhatsApp, right?

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, I get WhatsApp spam.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Not a lot, but I get it.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Like, once every couple of weeks.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
SMS, I get once every couple of days.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Some of these I don't see because it's already, like, filtered.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Never have I ever received spam on Signal.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Anybody use Signal?

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Highly recommended.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
For secure messaging.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you want to be secure, do not use Telegram.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's slimy through and through.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay?

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Do not.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Unless you want the FBI to knock on your door.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No, seriously.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Do not use Telegram.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
SMS.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Just assume everybody reads it.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay?

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Just assume that it's not private.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
WhatsApp?

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Eh...

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Meta.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Do you trust Mark?

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Exactly.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Have you looked at him?

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't trust Mark.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Signal.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Public domain.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So, you can look at the code.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Eh...

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I trust Signal more than others.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Not that I trust it, but I trust that I did more than others.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So, if I had to, like, send something securely today, I would do Signal, I might actually split

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
the message in two parts and send something by a signal and something by WhatsApp.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Are you getting what I'm saying?

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Right?

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah?

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But I message is distinct, right?

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right?

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I message is distinct, but I message is like a stupid overlay.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right?

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So, I message works for Macs and iPhones.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What about the rest of it?

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a stupid walled garden religion that Apple imposed on us.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Right?

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So, yes, iMessage, if you live entirely within Apple universe, iMessage is okay.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But the problem is, many of us, maybe not you all, but many of us people who use Apple

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
products communicate with non-Apple users.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And you don't often pay attention or know that your text message isn't an iMessage, but

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
goes out of the Apple universe.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And the moment it goes out of the Apple universe, it no longer has that security.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, and then, so text messages and messaging apps, you know, have a lot that can present.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Phone calls, yeah?

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If your phone number is somewhere, chances are, you know, you will get text spam.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry, phone spam by robocalls, sometimes by live people, but that's, that's like not

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
really spam.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I mean, it's annoying.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And then email is, uh, the lion's share of, of spam is 50% or so.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So, this is a disturbing thing.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So this is, a graph is kind of hard to read.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Uh, so look at the red part.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It just claims, again, I didn't double verify it.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It seems reasonably credible.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Number of people who lost money due to like scams, spam based scams.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So we're talking here from under 20 million in 2014, all the way to what?

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
close to 60 million in 2024.

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Now, I believe that this is cumulative.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So it's not like 2024, 60 million lost.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's all these other accumulated stuff that, by 2024, 60 million lost money.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I think that it's not, I don't believe this is a discreet per year.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Although there's a dip here, but I don't, I don't.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There's a dip here, but I don't believe it.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
They recovered their money.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Some probably did.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I would say very small percentage.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Very small.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What looks more is, uh, credible is, uh, the yellow part of the graph that shows the average,

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
uh, money per person lost.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You know, and these, uh, when it, when this talks about, uh, scam calls, it talks about also

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
email, right?

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So it includes email.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So things like, oh, you know, we, here's a bill for, I don't know, Norton defender.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Or here's a thank you for your purchase of Adobe creative cloud.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Right.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You've seen those emails, right?

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They say, and here's the bill, or we charged your card or something like that.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Right.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And you call the number.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Somebody does, maybe a relative or a friend, and, uh, they give up their password because

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
they're tricked.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They lose the money.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Typically these types of scams do not result in like emptying of bank accounts because banks

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
often have some safeguards in place, but, uh, people do lose money and no longer.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Uh, subjects.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What kind of subjects?

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, it's no longer like Nigerian princes, right?

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Right.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Or Malaysian, uh, multi-billionaires, right?

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Who want to share their immense wealth, uh, with you.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Right.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Only if you provide a small amount of information on your bank account where they need to transfer.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Uh, but you've got prizes and giveaway job opportunities and banking, right?

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The banking spams are typically the ones you've seen where, uh, we identify the problem with

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
your account.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Please immediately call this number.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Or please click on this link to confirm, uh, your data, right?

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Or change your password.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Um, and this goes, actually, that's a separate category.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Request to change your password after your account.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then software download, right?

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I mean, uh, you have, we have a new release of, uh, an XYZ package.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Uh, we see you're using it and enjoying it.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Please download the free, uh, the next beautiful version of that package.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, my gambling.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Haven't seen that much.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm surprised it's 20%.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Adult content.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That used to be a lot more, a lot more.

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like 10 years ago, I would say half of the spam was porn or porn related.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Now it's, it's down.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There's probably a good, like social science explanation.

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Cryptocurrency scams.

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are they out there?

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Not a huge amount, but they're out there.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I see, I see spam.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I see spam with cryptocurrency.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Uh, especially, these are especially on WhatsApp and text.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Not so much by email.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And then all kinds of stuff.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Pharmaceuticals also used to be a huge thing, right?

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Huge.

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Uh, like 15 years ago.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Pharmaceuticals scams.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The usual.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Viagra, Cialis, boldness cures, weight loss.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Between those three, like lose weight fast, performance, sexual performance enhancements,

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and hair.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Sometimes it was loose hair.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Usually it was like regrow hair fast, right?

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So these three dominated.

173
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Now they're very small.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm surprised.

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And then, uh, okay.

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Romance scams.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's more like, that's a niche.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's not in this country so much.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's, that's outside.

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And now let's not confuse the dating app scams, right?

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's a whole different.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm not, I'm ruling those out here.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You know, these dating apps where they have bots and, uh, uh, that's a whole different

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay.

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Uh, here's some more numbers for you.

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
About 160 billion spam emails are sending it.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Billion!

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Billion, right?

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This price.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We have what?

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
4 billion people?

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
5 billion people on this earth?

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There's not many emails are sent every freaking day.

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Um, and that's good part of the 350 billion emails overall set.

195
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Uh, most people receive spam messages.

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The problem is what, so how does spam work?

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Uh, how, how do spammers harvest email addresses?

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, the most obvious like they crawl, right?

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They crawl the web and they look for email addresses.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And all these tricks that people used to do and still do with like, uh, you know, not

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
using the add sign, but say add or something, right?

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Or, oh, it's my name at blah, blah, blah.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Those don't work because these, these crawlers can convert us into email address.

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Sometimes the email address is a guest.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Like smith at yahoo.com is going to be an email address, right?

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Joey at yahoo.com.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Uh, you know, uh, Gene Sudik at gmail.com.

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Well, you need to know my last name, right?

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But, but you know, more predictable last names and first names, any combinations that are

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
going to be existing email.

211
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No, it doesn't take a rocket scientist.

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Most of the spam of actual people who send spam don't do the crawling.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Crawling is done by whole other people system that then sells this harvested spam addresses

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to the spam, right?

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
To the actual spam.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Also, they filter them.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So when they collect them, they actually test that they exist.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Right?

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So you get this, what's called data clean in the database world.

220
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So they clean the data and then they sell the giant, uh, collections of databases of existing,

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
uh, email addresses to those who actually want to send spam.

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Uh, maybe it will surprise you that the US sends the most spam.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There is most spam originates inside the US.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It may have actually been crafted somewhere else, but the, the sender from the email point

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
of view is here in the United States.

226
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Followed by China.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Uh, let's see.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The rest of them are important.

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Uh, financial.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Now, now this is some, because I was hoping we would have a lecture on phishing.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm not sure if we, at the speed we're going to have that.

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Phishing and spam are like fraternal twins.

234
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay.

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now, spam can be without phishing.

236
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And if I draw a Venn diagram, there will be a giant overlap.

237
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You know, everybody knows a Venn diagram, right?

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Between spam and phishing, but they have distinct parts.

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So, spam is a vehicle for phishing.

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Often.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Not always.

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Spam can be also selling, I don't know, pharmaceuticals, right?

243
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is that phishing?

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No.

245
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
A lot of that stuff is like you want to buy, uh, Adderall.

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Maybe because it's without prescription.

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It may be illegal for you to do so.

248
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But if you go to the website and enter your credit card, they won't steal it.

249
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
They will ship you Adderall, maybe.

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Or if you want to, uh, I don't know, buy something else, right?

251
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I mean, uh, a walk, what is it?

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The typical one?

253
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
A walk-in bathtub.

254
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Everybody knows what that is?

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
For some reason, there was a favorite subject of spam for a while.

256
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's for old people or people who are handicapped.

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
A walk-in bathtub is a bathtub that has a door that you don't have to, like, step in.

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes?

259
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You've seen those?

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Ever?

261
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No?

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Ever seen spam on that?

263
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Very popular stuff for a long time.

264
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So, surely there is a walk-in bathtub you can buy, probably overpriced.

265
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay?

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So it's not phishing.

267
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's just selling crap.

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's the same idea that you get in the mailbox, right?

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You get these useless things, if you ever check, like, actual mail, physical mail.

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You get these useless advertisements, right, for stuff that you don't need most of the time.

271
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
A sail in some, you know, Nordstrom's rack or whatever.

272
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's physical spam.

273
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And, you know, a walk-in bathtub or, I don't know, cheap solar batteries installed in three minutes.

274
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's also that kind of spam.

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not phishing.

276
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Phishing is what they want to extract something from you that is, like, very personal.

277
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Like, credentials.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Right?

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay.

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, yeah.

282
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Delivery services.

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We have a package for you, right?

284
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is typical via text, right?

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Typically SMS, right?

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Because a lot of the delivery services, FedEx, DHL, right?

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Amazon, right?

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They use SMS.

289
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Many do.

290
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And so you get this unsolicited text from some special, like a four-six-digit number, right?

291
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's not really typically a real phone number.

292
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And it says, we have a delivery.

293
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's waiting for you.

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We just need you to confirm your credit card.

295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Details.

296
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Maybe you won't find that surprising.

297
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,680
Men 65 and over received the most spam calls.

298
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
No.

299
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
No.

300
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
Not.

301
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
No.

302
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
No.

303
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
No.

304
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
No.

305
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
No, no.

306
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
No.

307
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
No, I'm not.

308
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
All right, I'm sorry.

309
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
Very.

310
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Holy shit.

311
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
Oh.

312
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,680
No.

313
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
No.

314
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,680
No, no.

315
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:50,760
and men 18 to 34 the less the least

316
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:57,500
any explanation when you might think that's so

317
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:05,780
what happens at 65? usual retirement right?

318
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:11,160
yes but retirement right? so you have

319
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,400
idleness right? so you're a working man

320
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,160
you're a working person you don't have time to talk to spammers

321
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,080
right? or follow up on some email

322
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,240
you just ignore whatever you're retired

323
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,080
now all of a sudden you have a lot of time on your head

324
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,040
you're bored and you have money

325
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,720
yeah? you have money you save money you work all your life or whatever

326
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,720
65 not that long maybe but so these are the most ripe

327
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,780
the most ripe soil for spammers

328
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,360
people with disposable income who are idle and bored

329
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,960
these people I mean crypto millionaires aside

330
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,360
right? these people have no money

331
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,360
and they have the attention span of a food flight

332
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,360
right? not a good target for spammers

333
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,420
these people also remember these are like boomers

334
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,420
here 65 and over are boomers

335
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,360
different generation more perhaps more trusting

336
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,360
a little more serious you know

337
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,360
these people roughly your age

338
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,420
I mean these are men mind you but I think women get fewer

339
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,420
but I don't know how to explain that

340
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,360
list not obvious questions

341
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
alright let's switch into something a little more technical

342
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:45,360
so email have you ever wondered what your email does when it leaves your hands when you click send?

343
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,420
was that covered in any networking courses? yes?

344
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,420
not here

345
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,420
thank you

346
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,420
not here

347
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
where?

348
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
I want to go there

349
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:05,420
yes I suppose it wasn't covered in networking courses here unfortunately

350
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,420
which it should be

351
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
so you are the sender

352
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,420
you have your

353
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,480
are you all like browser email users?

354
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,480
who is a non-browser email user?

355
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,480
anybody use an email front-end?

356
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
like an email program?

357
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,420
no

358
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
wow

359
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,480
sign of the times

360
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,540
okay

361
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,540
it's a little different in your case

362
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
because

363
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,540
you are essentially using a front-end

364
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
kind of a fake front-end

365
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
your client browser

366
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,540
to access your gmail

367
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,540
right?

368
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,540
anybody here non-gmail?

369
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:52,540
you seem almost hesitant

370
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,540
look at this monoculture

371
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,600
you are all gmail users

372
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
is that because UCI dictates it?

373
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
do you have any other non-gmail accounts?

374
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
yeah

375
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
yeah

376
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
okay

377
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
but you use the browser as well to access those

378
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
interesting

379
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
well I don't think the browser on mobile devices

380
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
no

381
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:23,600
on the mobile devices I guess you use your mail app right?

382
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,660
well that's essentially the same thing right?

383
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
everybody uses like an API phone

384
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,660
well no

385
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,660
that's a different thing

386
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
okay

387
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
so let's think about your mail app

388
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
like

389
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,660
do people use mail on phones?

390
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,660
do you all use mail on phones?

391
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
like that?

392
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
okay

393
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,660
so you have an app

394
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
right?

395
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,660
good

396
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,660
so now we can connect better

397
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,660
you click send

398
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,660
your app is that

399
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,660
is that box over here

400
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
right?

401
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
that's your app over there

402
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
in that box

403
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,720
it's a computer but it's really like in this case be your phone

404
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
and so it's a client

405
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
it's an email client

406
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
and

407
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
when you configured it

408
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
you had to put some stuff in there

409
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
do you remember?

410
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,720
like you have to say what is your outgoing server?

411
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Nicole doing that?

412
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
no Nicole

413
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
oh they give you a profile?

414
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
it's just one of your most login

415
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,780
oh my god

416
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,780
oh my god

417
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,780
okay

418
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,780
so

419
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,780
with google

420
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,780
even if you are using gmail

421
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,780
with a client

422
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,780
it goes to

423
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,780
something called

424
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,780
smtp.something.something

425
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
which in this case

426
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,780
will be smtp.google.gmail

427
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,780
blah blah blah

428
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,780
and that's your relay

429
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,780
relay

430
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:46,840
now if your destination is in google world

431
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,840
that same mail relay is going to deliver it to the recipient

432
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
so you won't have this stage

433
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
this mail relay

434
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
if it's google

435
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
and your destination if you have it is google

436
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,840
it will just hand over to the recipient

437
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
actually it won't handle it

438
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
technically it just stores it

439
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,900
that some people either pop or imap server

440
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
but that's not interesting

441
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
but generally if you send email to some

442
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
let's say you have a friend in

443
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,900
I don't know American Samoa

444
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,900
and you send an email and they have an address with like

445
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
ending with S

446
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,900
I guess it would be ASA or something like that

447
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,900
it will be given to the mail relay

448
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,900
which is the outgoing server

449
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,900
and that server will figure out

450
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,900
what is the recipient's mail relay

451
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
okay

452
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,900
and it will hand over over the internet

453
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,900
generally this can actually be over the internet

454
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,900
and it will hand over the mail

455
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,900
and then it will get to the recipient

456
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
but that's a funny detail here

457
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,900
the recipient may have a separate server

458
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,900
where the mail is stored

459
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,900
that's usually what's called POP3 or IMAP

460
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
depending on how you configure it

461
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
mailbox

462
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
okay

463
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,900
so you actually fetch email from there

464
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
when you refresh

465
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,900
all right

466
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,900
but the important thing is to understand

467
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
is that this is not real time communication

468
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,900
remember I kept saying that email is stored forward

469
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
so like

470
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
if for example

471
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
this mail relay is down

472
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,900
this one will buffer your mail

473
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,900
you might even try a different mail relay

474
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:49,900
so that means it's kind of tolerant of delays

475
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
and failures

476
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
TCP is not right

477
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
so this is

478
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
if this was end to end TCP

479
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
it wouldn't work

480
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
but with mail relays because they are running

481
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
application layer right

482
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
yeah

483
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
setting up your own mail relay

484
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
you could in principle do that

485
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
you would have to get your own domain

486
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,900
probably for that

487
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
you can get a domain

488
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
you can buy one

489
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
you can set up your own mail relay

490
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
you can right now

491
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
let's say you are

492
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
you live in Irvine here

493
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
you are sort of stuck with COX

494
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
internet

495
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
you cannot set up your own mail relay

496
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
at least not easily

497
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
right

498
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,900
but if you buy your own domain

499
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
then you can

500
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,900
well I was saying

501
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,900
so if you set it up right

502
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
and then you are up to your own Gmail

503
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,900
and you are trying to send

504
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
if you set up your own mail relay

505
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
then it's a front end

506
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,900
so when you send mail

507
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,900
you would go for that relay

508
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,900
and then to Gmail

509
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
but if you are using the browser

510
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
it will still go directly to Google

511
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
your mail

512
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
your mail really will be irrelevant

513
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
you see because when you are using a browser

514
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,900
you are not using

515
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,900
you are not using the actual email

516
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
you are using like an interface

517
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
through the email

518
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
so it's like a storage forward component

519
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,900
can you like do a denial of service attack on the storage forward

520
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
like I assume there is only a limited amount of memory

521
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,900
generally mail relays have a lot of disk space

522
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,900
they don't keep those things in memory

523
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,900
they only keep them when they

524
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,900
if they try to send

525
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
if they cannot send

526
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
if the send does not succeed

527
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
they buffer on this

528
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,900
but you could presumably do like a malicious attack

529
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,900
you could make

530
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
but that will still

531
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,900
there is a limited amount of time

532
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,900
that it will try to retransmit

533
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
then it will delete

534
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,900
you will see mail undeliverable

535
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
how many of you have seen this?

536
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,900
undeliverable mail

537
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
that's an error message saying

538
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
he tried

539
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
he tried

540
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
and then he gave up

541
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,900
so

542
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
ok

543
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,900
ok

544
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,900
so

545
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,900
mail relay

546
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,900
forwards mail

547
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,900
to the next

548
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
hop

549
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
in principle

550
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
there could be more

551
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
most of the time

552
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
most of the time

553
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
today

554
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
you will have

555
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
at most

556
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,900
two mail relays

557
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
meaning you will have something like this

558
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,900
if you are sending mail

559
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
from

560
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
a domain

561
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
to a destination

562
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,900
in the same domain

563
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
you only have one relay

564
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
because that one relay relay

565
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,900
will deliver it right away

566
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
to the destination

567
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
does that make sense?

568
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
so

569
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,900
the way that email works

570
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
is governed by

571
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
a protocol called SMTP

572
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,900
simple mail transfer protocol

573
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,900
not extremely simple

574
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
but not too complicated

575
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
ok

576
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,900
not like TCP

577
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
but it is a protocol

578
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
not a packet form

579
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
right

580
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
so

581
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
here you have

582
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
Bob

583
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
and Bob is

584
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
like

585
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
think of Bob as like

586
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
somebody writing an app

587
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
on their iphone

588
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,900
a mail app

589
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
or

590
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
like me

591
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
kind of Neanderthal

592
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
who has an email fronted

593
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
I run Thunderbird

594
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,900
so my email

595
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
is

596
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,900
is done by

597
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,900
Thunderbird

598
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,900
program

599
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
on my

600
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,900
laptop

601
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
so

602
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,900
I'm that guy

603
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
and

604
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
when I click send

605
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,900
SMTP

606
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
governs

607
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
how my

608
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
message

609
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,900
is transferred

610
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
to

611
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
my

612
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
nearest

613
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
outgoing

614
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,900
server

615
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
that is configured

616
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,900
in my profile

617
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
it is configured

618
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
in your profile

619
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
if you look into your mail app

620
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
on your iphone

621
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
or android

622
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
ok

623
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
you can actually see

624
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
what is the

625
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,900
address

626
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,900
the host name

627
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
of your outgoing

628
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
relay

629
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
this guy

630
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
this guy

631
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
here

632
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
it's

633
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
it's there

634
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,900
and then

635
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,900
so if the email goes to some organization

636
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
where Alice works

637
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
well that organization has its own

638
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
server or relay

639
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
and that

640
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
transfer

641
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
between

642
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
relays

643
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
or between servers

644
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
I use server and relay

645
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
interchangeably

646
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
is also governed by SMTP

647
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
ok

648
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
but it's

649
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
hop

650
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
by

651
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,900
hop

652
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
not end to end

653
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,900
hop

654
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,900
by hop

655
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
and then here

656
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,900
between

657
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,900
Alice's mail server

658
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
and actual recipient

659
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
there's something called

660
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,900
there's several

661
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
protocols for fetching

662
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,900
actually fetching email

663
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
because

664
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,900
what email does

665
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,900
is SMTP

666
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
delivers it

667
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
to the last pop

668
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
but not to the client

669
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
not to the recipient

670
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,900
the recipient has to explicitly fetch

671
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,900
mail

672
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,900
and that's done by

673
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,900
several protocols

674
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,900
one

675
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
you know

676
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
pop three is one

677
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,900
and IMAP

678
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,900
is another

679
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
and there might be others

680
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,900
as well

681
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,900
but these are the two

682
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
the two most popular

683
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
pop

684
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
post office protocol

685
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,900
and IMAP

686
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,900
stands for

687
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,900
internet mail

688
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
and something

689
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
agent protocol

690
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
or something like that

691
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
but we won't be talking about those

692
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,900
those are not very interesting

693
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
the most interesting part is

694
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
this

695
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
this

696
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
there are two

697
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
ports

698
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
and I'm gonna tell you a bit about SMTP

699
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
because I figured you never heard

700
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
how it works

701
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,900
alright

702
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,900
it actually

703
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,900
it's a little confusing

704
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,900
because it works

705
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
it works with two different ports

706
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
remember port socket

707
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,900
port

708
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
port 25

709
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
is a standard email port

710
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,900
it's been around since 1982

711
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,900
and

712
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
right around

713
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,900
very soon after IP and TCP were first proposed

714
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,900
it is beloved by spammers

715
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
because it is insecure

716
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,900
so the port 25

717
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,900
is essentially supporting what's called open relay

718
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
which I'll tell you about in a minute

719
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,900
it is supported by

720
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
it shouldn't be used

721
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,900
by your email front end

722
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,900
so your app for example

723
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
if you look at your email app

724
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,900
and the configuration of your email app

725
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,900
one of the things it will tell you there

726
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
is what protocol to use

727
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
maybe you have

728
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
you've tried to add an email account

729
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
to your email app

730
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,900
has anybody done this?

731
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
add an account

732
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,900
does it ask you a set of questions?

733
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
mine does

734
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,900
but that's because mine isn't set up in the standard way

735
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,900
but in my experience

736
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,900
all of them ask you questions

737
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
yeah

738
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
like you say

739
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
what is your username

740
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
right

741
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,900
what is your email provider

742
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,900
right

743
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
what is your username

744
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,900
it asks you password

745
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
right

746
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
then it asks you also like

747
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
what protocol

748
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
and that will give you choices

749
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
ok

750
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
so

751
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
25 is one choice

752
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,900
it might not be supported

753
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
and for good reason

754
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
because it's not secure

755
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
ISPs

756
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,900
right

757
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
the cloud hosting provider will often block it

758
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,900
what is it actually used for?

759
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,900
it is used for

760
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,900
this

761
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,900
relay to relay

762
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
server to server

763
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
originally

764
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,900
everybody used port 25

765
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,900
for like several decades

766
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
and then when spam became a problem

767
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
they introduced port 587

768
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
and that's the one you're more likely to see

769
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
587

770
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,900
when you configure your email

771
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
you know

772
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,900
even if it's done automatically

773
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,900
you can see it

774
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,900
in the configuration

775
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,900
okay

776
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
there's an internet rc

777
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
that's discussed

778
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,900
it has

779
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
what's called

780
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
a start

781
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,900
TLS option

782
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
it's not

783
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
it's an option

784
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,900
it's not a requirement

785
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,900
but when you use that option

786
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,900
your email

787
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
is transferred

788
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
over a

789
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
TLS connection

790
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,900
and that is primarily

791
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
for this

792
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,900
from your app

793
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,900
to the outgoing server

794
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
or from your front end

795
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,900
of your laptop

796
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,900
to the outgoing server

797
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
okay

798
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,900
it's a little bit confusing

799
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,900
but that's how it works

800
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
so

801
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,900
there are a lot of

802
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,900
what's called open relays

803
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
out there

804
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
meaning relays

805
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
that do not require you

806
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
to have an account

807
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
to establish a secure connection

808
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
they exist for various reasons

809
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,900
sometimes they exist because

810
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
you know

811
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
operators of those relays

812
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
get money

813
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
from spammers

814
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
and other businesses

815
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
sometimes they exist because

816
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,900
people who configure them

817
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,900
and set them up

818
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,900
believe in

819
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
freedom of speech

820
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
they just don't allow

821
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
anybody to send email

822
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
through them

823
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
okay

824
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
now

825
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,900
what does an open relay do

826
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,900
or what does a relay in general do

827
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,900
it is

828
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
processing

829
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,900
so it receives an email

830
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,900
from the previous

831
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
haha

832
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,900
it looks at the header

833
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,900
and it looks to where does it need to go

834
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,900
right

835
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
what is the destination

836
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
like alice

837
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,900
abc.com.au

838
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,900
which means

839
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
the company named ABC

840
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,900
AU is in Australia

841
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,900
so it needs to go to Australia

842
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
and so

843
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,900
it finds out

844
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,900
what should be the next relay

845
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,900
topic

846
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,900
maybe

847
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,900
smtp.abc.com.au

848
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
maybe

849
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,900
smtp.abc.com.au

850
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,900
let's say that's the next email

851
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,900
it establishes a TCP connection

852
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,900
and then via smtp transfers the message over

853
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,900
but as it transfers the message over

854
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
it adds

855
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,900
it adds

856
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,900
a received from

857
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
a line

858
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,900
okay

859
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,900
into the header field

860
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,900
and maybe if you looked at the actual raw email

861
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,900
you might have looked at the raw email message

862
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,900
in plain text

863
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:14,900
have you seen that it has several usually several lines that say received

864
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:20,900
that is essentially the path that your email took to get to you

865
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,900
okay

866
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:27,900
that tells you exactly the sequence of relays that it traversed in order to get to you

867
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:33,900
and an honest relay according to the scientific protocol needs to add itself to the received

868
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
right

869
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,900
so the header grows as an email hops around the internet the header grows never shrinks

870
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,900
so when you receive it you actually see the exact route it took

871
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,900
not IP route not IP route but a mail route

872
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:54,900
now if the relay is hacked or it's malicious it doesn't have to do this

873
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,900
it doesn't have to abide by the protocol

874
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,900
and that's why for example spam may be very confusing

875
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,900
you might not exactly see the hops it took

876
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,900
especially typical thing is that the spammer has a

877
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,900
as the first hop a malicious relay

878
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,900
that does not add its name or adds some incorrect name

879
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
and why to confuse you

880
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,900
so you don't know where the intel actually comes from

881
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:30,900
SMTP will not surprise you

882
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,900
does not have any built-in authentication

883
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,900
no built-in security whatsoever

884
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
okay

885
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
like IP

886
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
like TCP

887
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,900
it was an internet program

888
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,900
one of those protocols designed in a different at a different time

889
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,900
right

890
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
50 years ago

891
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900
when things were very very different

892
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
let's see

893
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,900
mail from

894
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,900
right

895
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,900
you've seen it

896
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,900
right

897
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,900
if you look at the raw text email

898
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,900
mail from is supposed to be where it actually comes from

899
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,900
right

900
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,900
bob

901
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,900
xyz.com.ca

902
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,900
which would be

903
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,900
company xyz in Canada

904
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
okay

905
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
but

906
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,900
can you trust it

907
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,900
no

908
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,900
of course not

909
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,900
I

910
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,900
just

911
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
it's like the sender

912
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,900
sender can put anything you want

913
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,900
who wants to put

914
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,900
you know

915
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,900
moron.trump

916
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
and whitehouse.com

917
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,900
go ahead

918
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,900
chancellor gilman

919
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
fbci.edi

920
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,900
whatever

921
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,900
he can do it

922
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
so

923
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,900
and then the recipient

924
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
right

925
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
only sees the IP address

926
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,900
of the direct peer

927
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,900
meaning that

928
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,900
the last hop

929
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,900
from which

930
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
so the only thing you can trust

931
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
is that of the IP address of the last hop

932
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
from the email

933
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
that's it

934
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
of their relay

935
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,900
so here's the language of India

936
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,900
this is what actually happens

937
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,900
right

938
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,900
between

939
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,900
a sending mail server

940
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,900
like on a client

941
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,900
so this is in case of your app

942
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,900
your mail app

943
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
on your app

944
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
on your phone

945
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,900
and the first

946
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,900
mail server

947
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,900
first it says

948
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,900
some people

949
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,900
hello

950
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,900
right

951
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
so this is on port 25

952
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,900
port 25

953
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,900
in a

954
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
in a

955
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
in a

956
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,900
in a

957
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
in a

958
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
in a

959
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
sorry

960
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
let me

961
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,900
let me take that

962
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
sorry

963
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,900
this is between two relays

964
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,900
not between your client

965
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,900
not between your email client

966
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,900
on your app

967
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,900
but rather

968
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,900
between two relays

969
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
the sending relay

970
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,900
and the receiving relay

971
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,900
okay

972
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
so this is using

973
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
port 25

974
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,900
because that's allowed

975
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
between

976
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
email servers

977
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,900
hi there i want to send you email

978
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,900
so it says

979
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,900
this is not after TCP connection

980
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,900
is established

981
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,900
i don't show it

982
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,900
here

983
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,900
then it says to some people

984
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
hello

985
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
it's not going to spell it

986
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
that's how it is called

987
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,900
uh

988
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
and now the reply is

989
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,900
okay

990
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,900
i'm ready to receive email

991
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,900
from you

992
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
then it says

993
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,900
uh

994
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
the mail i'm about to send you

995
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,900
is from

996
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,900
uh

997
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,900
uh

998
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,900
hello

999
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,900
dot com

1000
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,900
and uh

1001
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,900
what the receiving mail server is supposed to do is look at that address and say

1002
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:17,900
do i want to do i trust this address do i want to forward email that came from this address

1003
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,900
right

1004
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
right

1005
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
and generally

1006
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
i mean unless it

1007
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:46,900
so you can have a blacklist for example it can consult some spam address database or it can have its own configuration it says okay good 250 means okay here is where it's going to then the sending server says it's going to mary at sweet tooth dot com the receiving server says okay let me check that address do i know where that is

1008
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,900
what that is

1009
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,900
do i like this address

1010
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,900
is it

1011
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,900
is that a

1012
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
suspicious address

1013
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
maybe it's a non-existent address

1014
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,900
if it's fine it says yeah looks good 250 okay

1015
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,900
and then

1016
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,900
this

1017
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
this

1018
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,900
here

1019
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,900
is a data transfer

1020
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
right

1021
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,900
actually it's one line at a time

1022
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,900
text

1023
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
bam

1024
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
bam

1025
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
bam

1026
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
the last message

1027
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
is a dot

1028
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,900
a one line with just a period

1029
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,900
that signifies end of message

1030
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,900
i know

1031
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,900
weird

1032
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,900
so

1033
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
when you said

1034
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,900
if you were to insert in your mail a period

1035
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,900
like when you type when you type out in your email

1036
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,900
if you insert a period on by itself on a line

1037
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,900
it's masked

1038
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:39,900
so that otherwise writing would be misinterpreted as the end of email so it is masked with a slash i think or something like that

1039
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,900
so

1040
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,900
it has to be like one period on a line that says okay we're done

1041
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:52,900
at this point we're done then there's a quit command and then they acknowledge that this is kind of an error message but it means i acknowledge we're done

1042
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,900
yeah

1043
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,900
is there any particular reason it has to be six back and forth or is it just the first thing they thought

1044
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,900
uh

1045
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,900
uh

1046
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,900
uh

1047
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,900
good question i don't know

1048
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,900
clearly this could be done differently right

1049
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,900
but that's that's how they're that's how the purple works

1050
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:15,900
you mean these hello okay mail from okay but uh yeah i mean of course you could you could imagine um

1051
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,900
hello is not just okay we're talking this is the beginning of the email of SMTP

1052
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,900
right because TCP is is below it's already established but above it is SMTP protocol right

1053
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:36,900
so the first two exchanges are they need to be there right just to say we are i i speak SMTP you speak SMTP

1054
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:45,900
the second two exchanges like mail from okay recipient to okay those could be combined indeed

1055
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:52,900
i don't see a reason why they're separate but that's just historically how it works

1056
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,900
so it looks more complicated than it is right it's not that difficult

1057
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:05,900
now this is how port 557 works this is also SMTP protocol but this is between your email client on your

1058
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,900
the app on your phone or a front end on your laptop and the outgoing server that's supposed to be more secure

1059
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:23,900
so uh instead of hello it's hello which means extended hello why because it's more sophisticated

1060
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:33,900
okay mail from same as before okay bob looks okay then sending to alice yahoo.com okay check that is okay

1061
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:43,900
then send data all right every piece of data is line by line until you see a period period is the end

1062
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:52,900
quit blah blah blah right so it's very very similar except that if you wanted to secure it you could do it

1063
00:40:52,900 --> 00:41:00,900
you could do it you could use a tls option that's called a start tls this is a version that would use start tls

1064
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:08,900
tcp handshake i showed you here but the beginning then there's really hello 250 means okay and then

1065
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:16,900
then the receiving email server adds an option count saying start tls it means i support tls

1066
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:26,900
tls the email client acknowledges 2.8 means go ahead and then there's a tls negotiation there's actually a tls session

1067
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:40,900
set up here okay and that email is sent over that tls and chances are in new york now stock tls is due

1068
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:46,900
i can definitely see when i configure a new email account one of the options is pick start tls and

1069
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,900
sometimes your email provider if you don't pick it will not will refuse to work because they say no no no

1070
00:41:52,900 --> 00:42:02,900
i want you to use start tls make sure the email is secure now the typical header fields in an email i can

1071
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:08,900
attach that you probably see are like these this is not there are more there could be a lot of extended maybe

1072
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:14,260
you see a lot of fields there called x dot dash have you seen if you look at the email remember

1073
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:20,900
the same thing feels like s dash that's extended optional fields but the required fields are these

1074
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:29,700
two to whom is this email this is one or more destinations carbon copy right who is copying on

1075
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:38,100
these emails and then blind carbon copy okay everyone knows what dcc is what's the stupidest thing anybody can

1076
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:49,460
have a doubt do with bcc have you ever received email by bcc i've never replied to an email by bcc

1077
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,540
that's the stupidest thing you can do

1078
00:42:54,020 --> 00:43:00,900
does everybody see what i'm saying if you receive a mail by a bcc you use your address is in bcc that

1079
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:06,260
means everybody else does not see your email as one of the recipients you are a hidden recipient

1080
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,380
but if you do reply all

1081
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:17,300
everybody will see that yeah you got that email and you weren't on the address list

1082
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:26,180
you must have been bcc so don't do reply all if you're a bcc on email okay bcc then from who created

1083
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:31,300
this email the email address usually with a name sometimes with a name not always with a name right

1084
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:33,780
sender

1085
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:42,340
usually the same receive okay this is where you have one or more lines of the path

1086
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:49,460
right in this case just that is line added by each trip but it uses the word transfer agent but the

1087
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:57,300
sftp relay or server to show you the hops it went through return path right path back to the center

1088
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,220
let's look at this mail plain text

1089
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:15,780
received by received by so return path received received

1090
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:22,900
spf we'll talk about this message id from to subject

1091
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:30,260
okay you see the first receive gives you an ip address

1092
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,180
that was done 12 in a time stamp the second says

1093
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:43,540
received actually the same time stamp is possible because the time stamp is in seconds so

1094
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:50,260
uh it is quite possible pacific standard of time uh sftp id is a typically a

1095
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:56,020
hash of the message some kind of hash that can be assigned every email server can use its own

1096
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:02,260
heuristic to assign it but the ip addresses are supposed to be legitimate ip addresses

1097
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,820
return path some email address

1098
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:18,500
uh spf is called the center policy framework we'll talk about it it's basically a um

1099
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:28,740
this distinction between trusted and untrusted uh sources at the particle uh okay and then there is the

1100
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:36,500
person presumably who sent this email uh it generally should match return path you see return

1101
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,380
path path and and the front should match

1102
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,700
this is the destination so the victim here is this person

1103
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:59,300
so this stuff is inserted by relays all of that

1104
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:12,820
this one link pr is a isp in puerto rico okay

1105
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:21,700
it claims to have and you see what's there in a uh parenthesis in the brackets is an ip address

1106
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,340
it's supposed to correspond right so the one link pr.net is supposed to correspond to that address

1107
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,260
actually that is somewhere in mongolia

1108
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,540
how do you know if you ping right if you trace your output it's in mongolia

1109
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,780
so already we have that's the spam which means it's an artificially crafted

1110
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,340
uh message

1111
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:55,540
one in the game of bingo so why do spam spammers want to hide their sources

1112
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:01,140
right so there is this fundamental thing right when you get spam

1113
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:07,140
it obviously wants you to do something right if you fall for it it wants you to take an action

1114
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:16,180
like buy viagra or walk in bathtub or you know order some i don't know some crap on the internet

1115
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:22,980
right i mean it sends you somewhere right it's not a spam saying it's usually not like oh i don't know

1116
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:31,620
vote for uh candidate this you get the spam around election time right but um that's different so

1117
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,620
typically it wants you to do something so why if they want you to do something

1118
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:46,260
meaning go to some website or reply then why would they hide their sources you see the problem

1119
00:47:50,500 --> 00:48:00,660
they hide their sources not so much from you the recipient but from your provider your isp and others who want to kill spam

1120
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:09,460
you see the distinction they don't really care so much that you know where it comes from they don't want

1121
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,380
others to know so they can't be blacklisted what was your question

1122
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:26,660
that's true that's true but typically you say you think right intuitively that oh you know it's the

1123
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:34,020
some even it's either that seller or the agent of the seller that's advertising this product right that

1124
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:40,100
that they're trying to get me to buy there should be a connection but that doesn't have to be right

1125
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:47,620
the seller for example could be in a place where they they you know in some other country

1126
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:54,420
and their email address might be filtered by policy like so what they do is they say you can

1127
00:48:54,420 --> 00:49:00,740
contract the spammer in the united states they send the spammer a template i want you to

1128
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:11,060
to send to this 10 million addresses this type of message that says dear so and so i am god knows who

1129
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:20,580
a nigerian prince recently deceased with a lot of money to give away right but the idea is that okay

1130
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,460
if it comes from nigeria right if you see the head of nigeria it would be it would be thrown away but

1131
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:33,300
if it comes from the us source it won't be right if it's a us isp so that's the reason

1132
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:40,900
now of course spam filters they they do check the bodies of messages so you you you have these various

1133
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:46,260
like uh sophos and spam assassin and you might sometimes get from uci write these messages saying

1134
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:51,620
that we quarantine some messages right have you seen those you have to like to get them you have to

1135
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:57,940
clicks that go to some link and you know click that's true but spammers are really good at like

1136
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:04,340
evading them that's a whole separate subject right how do they evade spam filters because spam filters

1137
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:10,180
basically you know use some heuristics of ai but you know anything that they do can be circumvented if

1138
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,180
they know if you know the algorithms anyway

1139
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:23,700
there are these clearing houses i think they're still around spam houses spam spam cop dot net these

1140
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:30,420
are non-profits that you maintain giant data banks of uh spam addresses right there's spam providers

1141
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:38,820
spam relays um these and this is where your relays these are the typical databases that your mail relays

1142
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:43,860
will consult in you know as they try to deliver emails and so they will stop like between 15 and

1143
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:52,900
40 percent of spam but majority of spam still gets through okay uh the other problem is that by the

1144
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:57,540
time they check the bandwidth is already consumed right so the email can email consumes a lot of

1145
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:05,700
bandwidth as you can imagine especially if you have uh html inside email right or or some other markups

1146
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:12,020
right now you have s- does everybody know the s- is secure multimedia mail extension this is when you

1147
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:18,020
you receive email that is like signed or you know it has multiple parts and so on these these are giant

1148
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:24,500
or can be quite large uh messages not the typical text email that you get and so that if spammers use

1149
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:33,220
that it's very difficult um to prevent them from consuming bandwidth so for evading plot tests sorry for evading

1150
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:40,260
for evading for evading blacklists with blacklists typically don't say oh filter everything with the word

1151
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:51,540
viagra or anything with the word uh bathtub no they typically list uh ip addresses and host names of known spammers

1152
00:51:51,540 --> 00:52:03,780
so one time trial and very effective trick that spammers use is called thin pipe thick pipe

1153
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:12,100
and it works like this so you have a target server let's say that serves uh let's say a particular company

1154
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:21,220
let's say uci ready right so this is our uh sftp server and the spammer wants to send a lot of spam to

1155
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:35,540
uci uh people like us okay so the spammer controls a botnet a botnet is full of zombies okay zombie botnet

1156
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:44,820
lsz stands for low speed zombie so this could be like one of your desktop computers in your lab or

1157
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:51,220
you know it could be a an old laptop that you have at home some would be even an iot device

1158
00:52:53,780 --> 00:53:01,460
then the high speed bot is somewhere else this is geographically far away not near anywhere near the

1159
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:08,180
low speed zone low speed zombies are many there are thousands maybe tens and thousands of them so

1160
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:18,100
so the bot picks a zombie and says hey do a tcp handshake with that server right open smtp connection

1161
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:27,380
then pass on the tcp sequence numbers remember tcp sequence numbers offset

1162
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:42,900
to this high speed bar you might be getting where what i'm about to say bam send bulk mail with a source

1163
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,420
low speed zone

1164
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:53,860
remember ip addresses are not a form of authentication so so the high speed bot takes over the tcp session

1165
00:53:53,860 --> 00:54:01,860
you see what's happening here this session was initiated by a low speed zombie as soon as the

1166
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:09,300
three-way tcp connection is established it passes on the sequence number to its big brother here

1167
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:16,660
the big brother says all right and sends a lot of spam over to the target server

1168
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:23,300
a target server thinks that this craft comes over on that connection you see

1169
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,580
cool what happens

1170
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:40,820
the high speed zombies ip address is hidden from the target server because what will happen

1171
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:49,060
okay remember how tcp works right it's all acknowledgement right data acknowledgement data

1172
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:56,100
acknowledgement and data can flow both ways but in email right in email what's happening is one relay

1173
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:02,660
has mailed message to send the other one is the receiver so the receiver does not send big data back

1174
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:11,700
right there's no messages to send back it's the sender that sends the message so the sender splits the

1175
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:16,740
message into chunks remember like tcp segments right because that should be long the email message can be

1176
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:22,900
long and it sends them with this via this tick line

1177
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:32,820
with the ip address of the low speed zombie now that that target victim server is going to do

1178
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:37,940
acknowledgments remember tcp acknowledgments they're not going to come on the thick pipe

1179
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:45,140
do you see why they cannot right because the acknowledgments will go to the ip address of the

1180
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,300
low speed zombie we don't assume that these guys are controlling internet routing

1181
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:55,940
so that this guy cannot force the tcp acknowledgments from this target server to come to it

1182
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,620
he cannot

1183
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,860
they will come here and that's okay they're in cahoots with each other

1184
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:05,780
so

1185
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:15,220
he's going to keep passing the offset now low bandwidth and this is a low bandwidth channel right low bandwidth

1186
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:23,780
the bulk of the data gets transmitted here it's a beautiful arrangement and it works now

1187
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:30,660
eventually the target the cdp server will say hey this is spam right somebody will mark it as spam

1188
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:36,740
and you'll say oh when did i receive it i received an ip address belonging to the low speed zombie

1189
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:45,540
okay let's left list the zombie done no more email from that a b address is accepted that's okay

1190
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:57,140
the high-speed bot goes on to the next zombie because he has thousands okay that other zombie that's done

1191
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:01,620
barrier that g you get the idea

1192
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:12,260
there are seven like amazing front-end tools for sending spam this is like one a bit old but it's an

1193
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:21,460
example this is a sensei program for windows it's a it's a spam automator you can configure it

1194
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:31,220
to send you see that it it from emails you can consider you can configure it to be like administrator

1195
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:43,140
at uciadu president usa.gov uh god at heaven dot earth whatever you want you can put it in the from

1196
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:50,580
uh you see the two aliases right this is to whom is this supposed to go webmaster administrator database

1197
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:58,660
okay you can vary all of these things subjects you see the subjects vary the subjects right hi hello

1198
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:04,340
how are you doing montano c etc okay and here's the actual middle text

1199
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:13,060
it's marked up dear black right so the name will go in there meaning the name two

1200
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:20,980
dear webmaster we'll go in there or or you see there's like a you don't want right here there's a

1201
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:28,180
or there is an or or dear colleague don't even need to like specifically address the person or

1202
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:37,220
hi account this is the typical way to identify when you see when you know it says hi john at uciadu

1203
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:48,820
have you ever received non-spam that says hi john at uciadu or or anything any greeting followed by your

1204
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:56,340
account name obviously that person does not know your name right so that's like a 99.99 indicator of

1205
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:02,180
spam when somebody refers to you by your account name but i guess people fall for it sometimes

1206
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,900
but it's a very nice automator

1207
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:14,900
all right uh if you're wondering where you know where the open proxies are that you can actually

1208
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:22,740
spend uh spam through well there's whole clearing houses of these of these proxies that you can what

1209
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:29,700
does it mean you can go there find a proxy that is alive and configure that proxy to be your outgoing

1210
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:36,260
smtp server so when you send email instead of going to google right or instead of going to uci

1211
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:44,500
uh smtp edu it will go to that open proxy okay so you can set this down through

1212
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:52,420
blacklisting turns out not to be enough because most ip addresses just like in a thin type

1213
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,340
thick type example with a low speed zombie most ip addresses send very little standards

1214
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:03,060
so blacklisting that's why is is very limited uh effectiveness because you blacklist something

1215
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:06,420
and it will never spend some time again anyway by the time you blacklist it it's too late

1216
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:14,820
right what does it show you it's a fraction of clients that says crap in number of appearances

1217
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:19,060
it means most of them said like once and then they go away

1218
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:29,700
okay because they're disposable where they come from well this is a while ago okay this is uh this

1219
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:35,300
is a this is a this is a while ago but at the time this is like almost 20 years ago these were i

1220
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:42,980
see the as number these are the organizations where spam originally it doesn't mean they spend spam it means

1221
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,420
their clients sent spam

1222
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:52,900
the the picture would be very different today i already said that

1223
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:10,980
ah this was around 2010 2012 the world was ruled by uh what like half a thousand giant spam bots

1224
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:21,940
yeah that was the world back then two particular had the lion's share swisbee and rostock they dominated

1225
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:28,980
the world of spam they were not themselves creators of spam they were the engines of spam do you see what i'm

1226
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:37,060
saying they were sending spam they were not creating it they were taking it from their clients and amplifying it

1227
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:46,900
most of them used a provider in northern california nisp

1228
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:55,700
okay that was uh very happy making money on them right uh it was not a bot but it had all these

1229
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:02,020
clients right it hosted these command and control servers command and control server is the brain of a bot

1230
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:11,540
right as the word name suggests command and control and so both rostock and frisbee were hosted right

1231
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:17,940
there by this isp now you all know what the difference between hosting provider and isp

1232
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:24,180
there's very they're similar but not the same you know the difference what's the difference what's the

1233
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:30,660
difference what's the difference between a hosting provider and isp uh a hosting provider is like

1234
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,020
so an isp provides the internet service and that's it pretty much yeah

1235
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:43,860
a hosting a hosting doesn't provide internet service it provides like yeah it usually does i mean

1236
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:51,460
yes true technically no usually does but but its primary purpose is to let you put your stuff on there

1237
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:58,340
exactly so you can put your web server yeah on a hosting provider okay a world world press is a

1238
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:03,860
hosting provider right like that google is a hosting provider uh but uh you're also tiny

1239
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:10,820
this was a relatively small one but it hosted all this now when it was disconnected imagine this three

1240
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:18,980
quarters of the spam in the world disappeared overnight that was incredible i remember it because uh

1241
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,780
all of a sudden i heard of it like two days later i realized i used to receive a lot of spam i went

1242
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:33,780
to my phone for the first time in 10 years there was no spam um now swisbee was it was an interesting

1243
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:39,860
character it was a rookie and a mailer right so basically it was a combination of malware and spam

1244
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:46,100
in order to have a a botnet you need to have zombies and you have zombies you must have malware they

1245
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:51,380
created those zombies and zombified them so there's always malware involved in creating a botnet

1246
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:55,220
it was at one point responsible for more than half the spam worldwide

1247
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:01,620
and when the mid-color uh hosting provider was taken down the zombies did not disappear right they

1248
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:08,100
still lived it's like you decapitate the head of the snake but the rest of it is still moving

1249
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:16,340
so the zombies were motherless all of a sudden right the mother ship has gone away but whoever created

1250
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:23,060
that botnet was pretty smart and they wanted to essentially for the zombies to look for a different

1251
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:28,820
mother or a different command and control center and they were programmed to do so and they started

1252
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:34,740
generating backup domains like this like weird looking backup domains and trying to connect to them

1253
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:43,460
thinking where's my mother where's my mother right and sure enough the people who were behind this

1254
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:51,220
botnet created for you know regain control of the zombies by creating a backup mother uh not surprising

1255
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:56,340
through a registrar registrar is the assigned name authority that uh assigns domain names in a given

1256
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:03,460
country every country has one well they did it for a russian registrar and hosted new commanding control

1257
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:10,260

1266
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:12,420
they would gmail actually use the smtp protocol or would they just like use standard you know in the
