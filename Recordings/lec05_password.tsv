0	17000	later in the course. That is, there was a back-end SQL database, very large database, that was somehow accessible via external web server.
17000	22000	Anyway, you see the pointers here, you can still read about these.
22000	32000	That is just a nice playground to analyze, and here are some statistics, some takeaways from that database.
32000	44000	These are top 20 passwords, and what you see is the rank, the password, and the number of users that selected that password.
44000	60000	Some of those are totally not surprising, right? Like ABC 1-3, 1-8, 1-7, Roku, because it's a Roku database.
60000	69000	Princess, I don't know, I can't explain princess, I don't know what that's about, but I love you, password, okay, those are easy to explain.
69000	78000	Monkey, I don't know, that must be a term of endearment in the UK, but then we'll be fine here.
78000	85000	Names, mostly female names for some reason, okay, maybe that's because most of the users were male.
85000	92000	This is the gaming side of it, so it's fair to prove the majority of the users were male.
92000	96000	Right, so that's kind of depressing.
96000	119000	Now, we'll come back to passwords later, but one of the things I want to illustrate is that sometimes companies, websites, and organizations come up with clever tricks to make it easy for users to pick passwords or pick and memorize pins.
119000	123000	Now, in this case, banks typically use pins, right?
123000	131000	For website access, they use password, but for ATM access, right, they use pins.
131000	136000	Also, on the phone, they often ask you, if you call a bank, they'll ask you for a pin.
136000	144000	And so, if you let users pick pins, you'll have the same problems as with passwords.
144000	146000	Users will pick dates, typically, right?
146000	156000	Or some kind of very familiar, predictable things like, I don't know, a street address or a phone number, right?
156000	164000	So, dates, street addresses, phone numbers are the most common choices for pins if you leave users the freedom to pick them.
164000	174000	So, this bank in the UK wanted to make it easy for users to memorize their pins.
174000	178000	But the pins were supposed to be random, okay?
178000	183000	Meaning, the bank would come up with a random pin and assign it to the user.
183000	185000	Are you with me?
185000	186000	Alright.
186000	188000	This happens here, too, even today, right?
188000	191000	Some banks do that.
191000	195000	Definitely, my bank did it about 10 years ago, and they stopped.
195000	198000	So, what they said is like this.
198000	206000	If you basically get a grid, like this, you see, a 4 by 10 grid.
206000	210000	And the top row is the numbers, right?
210000	218000	So, if the bank gives you a password, sorry, a pin that is 4 digits,
218000	227000	you basically pick your favorite 4 character word that you know you will remember,
227000	234000	and write it down from left to right on this grid.
234000	241000	So, in this example, the bank gave the password, sorry, a pin 2256.
241000	244000	That's presumably a randomly generated pin.
244000	249000	And the user happens to write the word blue, because 4 digits, right?
249000	251000	4 characters, blue.
251000	260000	So, if the user writes the word blue on this grid, where that 22, right?
260000	264000	Because BL are under 2, because that means the first characters,
264000	269000	the first digits should be 2 and 2.
269000	275000	And then UE, 5, 6, right?
275000	279000	So, the idea is that then, once the user has written it down,
279000	288000	all the other squares in this table are filled in with random characters.
288000	290000	Are you with me?
290000	293000	Now imagine, I wish I had better animation here,
293000	297000	imagine the rest of the squares filled with random characters,
297000	300000	also written in the same typeface in black, okay?
300000	302000	So, you cannot tell, right?
302000	308000	And the point of this is that, if you look at this cheat sheet, right?
308000	310000	You print this out, right?
310000	314000	You carry this around, this cheat sheet.
314000	316000	It only makes sense to you.
316000	318000	You'll remember your pin, because what you will do,
318000	322000	is you'll always remember your word, blue, right?
322000	325000	Blue is your favorite four-letter word.
325000	330000	So, when somebody else looks at this table,
330000	332000	and it's filled in with random garbage, right?
332000	334000	It's basically a bunch of letters.
334000	337000	They don't know.
337000	340000	You look puzzled.
340000	349000	So, normally, in order to guess a pin, a four-digit pin,
349000	353000	you would have to try up to, usually half,
353000	356000	10,000 possibilities, right?
356000	359000	There are 10,000 four-digit numbers.
359000	362000	On average, if you want to break somebody's pin,
362000	365000	you would have to try 5,000, right?
365000	367000	On average.
367000	371000	But, in this case, if somebody gets a hold of,
371000	376000	or takes a snapshot of this table,
376000	379000	it might seem like, oh,
379000	382000	there's lots of possibilities here, right?
382000	386000	At least as many as 10,000, right?
386000	389000	Because, actually, it's like this.
389000	390000	Look at that.
390000	396000	There are four rows that are empty under the number row, right?
396000	399000	And then there are 10 rows, right?
399000	401000	Sorry, 10 columns.
401000	403000	So, we have, basically,
403000	405000	4 times 4 times 4,
405000	406000	4 to the 10th, right?
406000	409000	Which is 2 to the 20 possibilities
409000	413000	of combinations of letters, right?
413000	415000	Actually, it's more,
415000	417000	because you can do the things you can have.
417000	421000	So, it seems like if you look at the combination of letters,
421000	424000	it's even more than there are pins.
424000	427000	But the truth is something else.
427000	430000	If somebody takes a snapshot,
430000	434000	or steals a copy of this cheat sheet,
434000	437000	all they have to do is look for English words,
437000	442000	from left to right, right?
442000	445000	They can go down and sideways,
445000	447000	or they can go just sideways, right?
447000	449000	Human eyes are good at that.
449000	453000	So, in fact, if you're looking for four-letter English words
453000	456000	in a randomly jumbled matrix,
456000	459000	where there is really just one four-letter English words,
459000	464000	there may be some accidental ones, right?
464000	469000	You will completely shortcut the pin-breaking process.
469000	472000	There will be maybe a few dozen possibilities
472000	475000	of four-letter English words,
475000	479000	and one of them will be blue.
479000	482000	So, that's an example of a clever trick
482000	487000	that makes it way easier for an adversary to attack the system.
487000	488000	Okay?
491000	493000	You still look puzzled.
493000	495000	Don't believe me?
498000	499000	Anybody?
499000	501000	Don't be afraid to ask.
503000	506000	Now, remember, it's all left to right, right?
506000	510000	The digits have to be moving, right?
510000	511000	There's your pin.
511000	514000	You have to remember your pin as you, the user, the owner,
514000	516000	has to remember your pin, right?
516000	520000	And so, you write a four-letter word,
520000	522000	but it's not written like this.
522000	524000	It's written in a certain way, right?
524000	527000	You have to be able to parse that word, find it.
527000	529000	You remember the word.
529000	531000	You look at this, you say, you're looking for,
531000	534000	if the word is blue, you're looking for the letter B.
534000	537000	Then you're looking for L, right?
537000	538000	Where's L?
538000	539000	Oh, it's here.
539000	540000	There's U.
540000	541000	There's E.
541000	542000	Okay?
545000	549000	Now, if you think that standard tricks like,
549000	552000	I don't know, spelling words backwards.
552000	555000	This is a typical children's trick, right?
555000	556000	This is the spell.
556000	559000	Some kids even play games with, like, speaking words backwards.
559000	562000	It helps, it does not.
562000	568000	Because the password databases that are out there already have them.
568000	571000	First and last names, common first and last names.
571000	576000	Most first and last names are just well-known and easy to calculate.
576000	582000	Street names, city names, state names, place names, mountain names.
582000	586000	All of those things are easily enumerable.
586000	591000	And all geographical locations in the world, in fact, are.
591000	593000	Same goes with upper lowercase.
593000	603000	If you know at least the scope of what users you are trying to have,
603000	605000	driver's license numbers, right?
605000	607000	If you know somebody is likely to live in California
607000	609000	and have a California driver's license number,
609000	610000	well, guess what?
610000	614000	All California driver's license numbers have a very similar format, right?
614000	619000	Like my driver's license, C6715402.
619000	620000	Okay?
620000	622000	Well, there's not a lot of digits there.
622000	625000	I mean, it's enough, but you can enumerate all of them.
625000	629000	License plates are also in kind of sequential.
629000	630000	License plates.
630000	631000	In California.
631000	632000	Yeah.
632000	633000	Well, there's that.
633000	636000	There was a time when even social security numbers had a structure.
636000	638000	Today, they don't.
638000	643000	But back in my day, you could look at a social security number and say,
643000	646000	oh, I know which state this comes from.
646000	651000	And I know roughly what year you are going to assign this social security number.
651000	654000	Today, they're not like that.
654000	655000	Okay.
655000	658000	Same goes for telephone numbers.
658000	662000	Point of language is if you think, oh, well, you know,
662000	664000	I'm going to use Swahili.
664000	665000	Meh.
665000	675000	Most common foreign languages are easily enumerable and stored in these password database.
675000	679000	Probably the best combination, and this is not something I can give you a proof for,
679000	685000	is if you don't want to use, let's say, if you're not good at picking things with special symbols
685000	695000	or remembering numbers, the best thing you can do is pick, I would say, three or more languages,
695000	700000	three is a good number, that you do not speak.
700000	701000	Okay?
701000	704000	And other people know you don't speak.
704000	711000	Because if people know you speak a particular foreign language, that helps in the attack, right?
711000	716000	Especially assume that people who will attack you are people who might know something about you.
716000	725000	Like your CV, which is on LinkedIn, might say, I speak Farsi, or I speak Albanian.
725000	727000	Well, that's a leak.
727000	734000	Because if you speak Farsi or Albanian, that is a high chance that you will pick a password from those languages.
734000	735000	Okay?
735000	743000	So what you do is instead pick three languages that you do not speak, but you know a few words.
743000	746000	You don't speak, but you know a few words from each.
746000	749000	Combine the three words, right?
749000	750000	Okay?
750000	752000	And then you have a password.
752000	755000	That makes it a lot harder for crap.
755000	759000	It can still be crap, but it's a lot harder.
759000	760000	Okay.
760000	770000	Well, then, in recent years, most reputable systems started to enforce length limits.
770000	773000	Meaning minimum length for a password, right?
773000	777000	What are the minimum lengths you see out there?
777000	781000	Eight is probably the lower bound, right?
781000	783000	I haven't seen less than eight for passwords.
783000	788000	For pins, it can be six, but eight, sometimes 12, right?
788000	791000	I have not seen more than 12.
791000	794000	Have anybody seen more than 12?
794000	795000	Right.
795000	798000	Have you seen upper limits?
798000	799000	Yes, right?
799000	800000	Upper limits exist.
800000	805000	And, yeah, I think we discussed that already, I think, last time, right?
805000	808000	Okay.
808000	813000	So, let's say most are today between eight and 12, and then what do they do?
813000	816000	They require one upper lower case.
816000	817000	Sorry, let's say, right?
817000	820000	One, I guess they require mixed case, right?
820000	822000	Often, not all.
822000	824000	Most require at least one letter.
824000	826000	Sorry, at least one number.
826000	831000	And if you use all numbers, they require at least one letter, right?
831000	833000	I believe that most people don't do that.
833000	836000	And then one special character, right?
836000	837000	Which is usually for a minute.
837000	842000	It does not often include like dollar sign or pound sign, right?
842000	849000	It will be like comma, exclamation, question mark, something like that, right?
849000	859000	And how effective is that, do you think?
859000	863000	I think people would try to use the minimum number of everything and then pattern that they...
863000	864000	Right.
864000	865000	That is true.
865000	868000	The studies have shown that people will use the minimum.
868000	874000	Studies show that people will use predictable things like, for example, you know, substituting i's with ones.
874000	879000	Substituting o's with zeros.
879000	882000	Which makes it very, very pretty difficult.
882000	887000	Adding one, two, three to the beginning or the end.
887000	891000	Adding usually exclamation points.
891000	896000	The typical thing is add one bang or one exclamation point, right?
896000	897000	Just to satisfy it.
897000	900000	Just to get rid of the annoying checker, right?
900000	901000	And let you...
901000	912000	So, yes, it is effective because it increases the search space, but no, not by a lot.
912000	916000	Also, using special characters is an interesting thing.
916000	926000	Now, how many of you have, let's say, logged in using special characters from keyboards other than American keyboards?
926000	927000	Anyone?
927000	928000	Nobody else?
928000	931000	Non-quality keyboards, like European keyboards.
931000	932000	Or Asian keyboards.
932000	933000	Just one person.
933000	934000	Okay.
934000	935000	Well, I'll raise my hand, too.
935000	936000	So, you know what?
936000	937000	Have you had any difficulties?
937000	938000	Not usually.
938000	939000	I'm kind of using the different...
939000	940000	I use it.
940000	941000	Okay.
941000	954000	Well, one of the things, if you go, let's say, to Europe, is you'll see the keyboards, although
954000	959000	they're kind of laid out, the letters are laid out in the same way, the special symbols aren't.
959000	966000	So, like, add sign, pound sign, they're accessible by a different combination than they are in the U.S.
966000	968000	That makes it a real pain.
968000	969000	Okay?
969000	977000	So, whereas if you constrain your passwords to only letters and numbers, you don't have these issues.
977000	978000	Okay.
978000	980000	Well, then, what about these guys?
980000	983000	Now, we briefly talked about password vaults and managers, right?
983000	985000	But let's consider them a little more seriously.
985000	987000	People do use them.
987000	990000	Some companies actually require the use of this.
990000	991000	Okay?
991000	999000	I'm not going to preach for or against them, but let's consider both sides of these things.
999000	1002000	I mean, it's kind of a cottage industry, too, right?
1002000	1006000	I mean, it's businesses that make money on it.
1006000	1011000	As I mentioned before, when we, I think, briefly touched upon it, they have to provide the same level of security
1011000	1019000	that a certification authority can provide for its CA, except that in this case, remember, the certification authority
1019000	1021000	has to be offline.
1021000	1026000	You can have some physically secure location, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?
1026000	1031000	Not connected to the internet, right?
1031000	1035000	This cannot be offline, right?
1035000	1040000	Because millions of users or thousands of users are using it all the time, right?
1040000	1045000	To retrieve passwords from the vault, right?
1045000	1048000	So the security requirements are harder.
1048000	1051000	Because if something is online, it can be accessed, right?
1051000	1053000	It's reachable.
1053000	1056000	Okay, but the good things are what?
1056000	1063000	So if you use a password manager or password vault, where it's via an app or website, whatever,
1063000	1071000	you can have super strong passwords, random long passwords that you don't have to remember.
1071000	1074000	It will remember them for you, right?
1074000	1077000	Basically, what is the password vault of password manager?
1077000	1090000	It has a small database for you, for your account, that lists all the websites or all the entities you do business with that require passwords.
1090000	1096000	It has your username and it has your password in the clear somewhere, right?
1096000	1106000	Because when you want to access the password manager and essentially to extract the password to enter into some website, it has to give you the password.
1106000	1108000	It cannot give you a hash, right?
1108000	1113000	It has to give you the whole thing.
1113000	1114000	So, hmm.
1114000	1120000	But anyway, it can have really strong passwords that you don't need to remember.
1120000	1124000	It will make sure you don't reuse passwords across sites.
1124000	1129000	Whereas, given freedom to do so, most people will be using passwords, right?
1129000	1131000	Most of you probably do too.
1131000	1134000	I know I have.
1134000	1139000	Because it's just a pain to remember a lot of passwords.
1139000	1145000	So, you go to one place, it's nice and convenient, like a supermarket.
1145000	1151000	You go there to get all your goods, and there's only one strong password to remember.
1151000	1155000	The one that unlocks the vault, right?
1155000	1158000	That's the password to other passwords.
1158000	1164000	So, you could argue that that password could be strong and you should be forced to remember it, but it's only one.
1164000	1168000	As opposed to many, so it's just basic goodness.
1168000	1170000	But let's look at the bad side.
1170000	1177000	The bad side, that becomes like, yeah, a giant pot of honey for bees.
1177000	1180000	Or, there's surely a better analogy somewhere.
1180000	1185000	But, it is an attractive target, right?
1185000	1189000	This is, why do bank robbers rob the banks?
1189000	1192000	Famously, because that's where the money is.
1192000	1194000	Well, why would somebody attack a password load?
1194000	1196000	Because that's where the passwords are.
1196000	1198000	And you can get a lot with those passwords, right?
1198000	1202000	So, there's a lot at stake.
1202000	1205000	Also, there's such a thing as insider attack.
1205000	1213000	Which is people who work for that company, who might go rogue one day, and decide to copy or steal information.
1213000	1215000	And sell it on the black market.
1215000	1216000	Okay?
1216000	1217000	For profit.
1217000	1221000	Then there's just other operational issues.
1221000	1225000	Not too much a security issue, but not strictly.
1225000	1230000	Where this password vault becomes a single point of failure.
1230000	1233000	It's basically a website, right?
1233000	1238000	You go to that website, or you access it by an app on your smartphone.
1238000	1240000	It is an entity, right?
1240000	1242000	That has to be accessed.
1242000	1247000	It isn't something that can be replicated on Akamai CDN.
1247000	1251000	No, it's a physical entity that has to be accessed.
1251000	1260000	And so, if they have software upgrade, like they did last August, if you recall there was an incident.
1260000	1261000	Right?
1261000	1263000	Maybe you do not recall.
1263000	1270000	That became a nightmare, because all the systems over the world, especially airlines, became inoperable.
1270000	1272000	Then you have an outage.
1272000	1276000	Or just somebody presses the wrong button, installs the wrong code, there's an outage.
1276000	1280000	So this password vault is not accessible, because they're performing maintenance.
1280000	1287000	Well, how are you going to get access to all the websites for which that vault knows the passwords, and you don't?
1287000	1289000	Just prove.
1289000	1291000	Denial of service attack.
1291000	1294000	We'll talk about those later in the course.
1294000	1302000	What if it is a massive distributed denial of service attack that essentially makes it impossible to access that password vault site?
1302000	1305000	Even though it's operational, but you can't access it.
1305000	1307000	You're screwed.
1307000	1310000	And then it could be just internet problems, right?
1310000	1320000	If you have an internet problem, meaning a router that is somewhere on the way that an internet router or an internet provider crashes, you can't access it.
1320000	1323000	And that completely gives you no service.
1323000	1326000	So consider those when using the vault.
1326000	1334000	Now, you might say, well, you know, if a smart company that runs one of those vaults wants to make the service ubiquitous, they will replicate things.
1334000	1341000	Tell them, oh, but replicating passwords, that's a touchy-feely subject, right?
1341000	1343000	How do you do that security?
1343000	1347000	And then you have to make sure that all the passwords are updated, right?
1347000	1349000	On all replicas.
1349000	1355000	Then, surely you're all familiar with screen unlocked.
1355000	1357000	How many people use those?
1357000	1358000	Not anymore?
1358000	1360000	Wow, like five years ago.
1360000	1362000	Pretty much more than that.
1362000	1365000	Three quarters of the class would be using it.
1365000	1367000	Anybody used them before?
1367000	1368000	Yeah.
1368000	1369000	Okay.
1369000	1370000	All right.
1370000	1371000	See?
1371000	1372000	When did you start?
1372000	1375000	When you switched to an iPhone or?
1375000	1377000	I think the phone all updated with Face ID.
1377000	1379000	No matter Android or Android.
1379000	1380000	Right, right.
1380000	1387000	So that's what I also, I never used these screen patterns unlocked, but I know people did.
1387000	1394000	At one point, everybody, it seemed to me like everybody was using it.
1394000	1396000	So, yeah, you're right.
1396000	1404000	The face unlock and the fingerprint, to a lesser extent, became a more common way of unlocking, because it required no real effort.
1404000	1405000	Right?
1405000	1410000	But the claim to fame of the screen unlock, right?
1410000	1412000	That pattern was it's easy to remember.
1412000	1422000	Somehow, it felt like, I mean, at least studies at the time showed that it's easier for people to remember the unlock patterns than it is to remember pins.
1422000	1423000	Right?
1423000	1425000	Because phones usually don't take passwords, right?
1425000	1427000	Phones were traditionally unlocked with pins.
1427000	1430000	It's just easier because phones have limited real estate, right?
1430000	1433000	On the screen, just playing a keyboard is awkward.
1433000	1434000	Right?
1434000	1435000	It is awkward.
1435000	1436000	Right?
1436000	1439000	Even for people with tiny fingers.
1439000	1442000	So, cool.
1442000	1443000	Back.
1443000	1449000	Easy to remember, easy to enter, right?
1449000	1453000	Just use your fingertips.
1453000	1456000	They're more intuitive than passwords.
1456000	1458000	That's for sure.
1458000	1460000	And more intuitive than pins.
1460000	1465000	On the other hand, they are specific to a particular phone on a particular screen.
1465000	1466000	Right?
1466000	1469000	Different phones have different screen layouts.
1469000	1475000	Even when they show you a numeric pad, they often show you it in a different way.
1475000	1478000	There was no standardization.
1478000	1483000	So, it was difficult to assure that the same, if you wanted to use the same unlock pattern
1483000	1488000	on multiple devices, you might not be able to do it.
1488000	1491000	Um, then the screen smudges.
1491000	1492000	I think I mentioned it earlier.
1492000	1493000	I did.
1493000	1495000	So, your fingertips have oils on them, normal.
1495000	1496000	Right?
1496000	1497000	It's not sweat or anything.
1497000	1501000	Like, even a dry looking finger will have some oil on them.
1501000	1502000	Right?
1502000	1506000	And, um, it will leave smudges on the screen.
1506000	1512000	Well, besides being annoying, meaning you have to clean the screen, it also leaves residue.
1512000	1515000	And that residue can be used to deduce the thing.
1515000	1520000	If somebody, like, looks at your phone, even without you being there, and just, like,
1520000	1533000	takes a high-dress photo of the screen, they might be able to deduce at least parts of these finger movements that you made to unlock.
1533000	1537000	It also turns out that there's acoustic leakage.
1537000	1542000	Remember I mentioned about acoustic emanations from keyboards when you type in a password?
1542000	1549000	Well, the same, to a lesser extent, but the same is true of, uh, dragging your fingertips across the screen.
1549000	1551000	You make a noise.
1551000	1554000	You might not hear it very well, but there is a noise being made.
1554000	1560000	Because even though the screen is glass, right, there's still friction.
1560000	1563000	And friction makes noise.
1563000	1568000	Um, it is also more susceptible to shoulder surfing.
1568000	1570000	And so the question is why?
1570000	1574000	So think, remember shoulder surfing?
1574000	1579000	I stand kind of behind you and kind of like, oh, look at what you're doing on the screen.
1579000	1584000	And typically against passwords, right?
1584000	1585000	Or pins.
1585000	1590000	But this, the claim is, is more susceptible to shoulder surfing apart.
1590000	1592000	Why do you think?
1592000	1596000	Visual products are easy to remember.
1596000	1600000	You don't even need to look at how he moved the finger.
1600000	1603000	You only need to see how he moved the head.
1603000	1605000	Maybe some people can guess.
1605000	1608000	Yeah, yeah, true.
1608000	1614000	But basically, the main reason what she said is that visual patterns are just easier to memorize.
1614000	1615000	Okay?
1615000	1625000	Now, if you have a camera, like, looking down on somebody's, like, for example, if there's a camera here and it's like looking at all your screens,
1625000	1629000	uh, there's no big difference between pins and unlock patterns.
1629000	1633000	But if it's a human, definitely easier to remember and unlock that.
1633000	1635000	Also, it proudly displays the whole pattern.
1635000	1636000	It does!
1636000	1637000	It does!
1637000	1638000	It does!
1638000	1639000	Which is weird, right?
1639000	1644000	In fact, I always wondered why it doesn't erase the tail.
1644000	1654000	You know how you type a password and it will, like, linger, every character will linger for, like, a second and then it will be replaced by an asterisk or something?
1654000	1659000	So the whole password is not displayed when you type it, obviously.
1659000	1662000	Why even do the same for unlock patterns?
1662000	1664000	It should be, like, a comment, right?
1664000	1666000	Like, erasing its own tail.
1666000	1667000	But they don't.
1667000	1669000	In the end, the entire pattern is visible.
1669000	1670000	True.
1670000	1671000	You had a question.
1671000	1672000	What?
1672000	1681000	Yeah, uh, back in the day, like, 2013, when Android all was, first off, popular, and screen-in-locks were all happening,
1681000	1686000	when you were setting up your phone, you had the option of, like, screen-in-lock, pin, password,
1686000	1689000	and they were all prominently really displayed.
1689000	1690000	Yeah.
1690000	1693000	Nowadays, if you get a new Android, it isn't hidden.
1693000	1695000	Like, you have to actually dig...
1695000	1697000	So you think, you're saying it exists?
1697000	1698000	Oh, it still exists, yeah.
1698000	1699000	Oh, it still exists, yeah.
1699000	1700000	My brother still uses it.
1700000	1702000	You get the new phone number if you want.
1702000	1703000	Okay, but when I asked...
1703000	1704000	What?
1704000	1709000	Must be working for a phone number.
1709000	1712000	But still, right?
1712000	1713000	Nobody's using it today.
1713000	1714000	No, it's hidden.
1714000	1715000	No, no, but all of you, okay?
1715000	1716000	Nobody's using it, right?
1716000	1717000	Okay, interesting.
1717000	1718000	Okay, you had a question.
1718000	1719000	What's up?
1719000	1722000	I was gonna say the tail disappeared in some of them.
1722000	1723000	In some of them it does?
1723000	1725000	Okay, well, hallelujah.
1725000	1726000	Good.
1726000	1729000	That would make more sense.
1729000	1733000	And also, the last but not least, people do tend to pick predictable patterns.
1733000	1735000	That's also been studied.
1735000	1738000	Yeah, you're not gonna pick some kind of a funny curly cue, right?
1738000	1743000	Usually it's kind of like a very predictable rectangular, triangular pattern.
1743000	1747000	All right, so what can we do to strengthen passwords?
1747000	1752000	Well, I mean, passwords themselves, we already kind of reached the limit, right?
1752000	1754000	There's no way...
1754000	1756000	Okay, humans are literate today.
1756000	1757000	We all can...
1757000	1760000	Because we use electronics, even those of us who don't go to...
1760000	1761000	Don't finish high school, right?
1761000	1764000	There are people in the world, lots of people in the world who don't finish high school
1764000	1766000	or get barely elementary school education.
1766000	1767000	They still don't.
1767000	1768000	Numbers, right?
1768000	1769000	They know letters.
1769000	1774000	So literacy is good, reasonably good, better than it was 50 years ago or 100 years ago.
1774000	1778000	But memorization is a problem, right?
1778000	1784000	So already memorizing 12 character passwords or 12 position passwords is difficult, right?
1784000	1788000	Assuming we even mix in special characters, numbers, lowercase, uppercase, et cetera.
1788000	1790000	So we've kind of reached the limit, right?
1790000	1792000	The humans are not going to develop beyond this.
1792000	1796000	And so all of a sudden, the next generation is going to be remembering 20 character passwords.
1796000	1797000	Not going to happen.
1797000	1798000	Okay?
1798000	1799000	So what can we do?
1799000	1801000	Well, we can add biometrics.
1801000	1804000	That's kind of an easy answer, right?
1804000	1806000	Add biometrics.
1806000	1814000	And so, for example, I have fingerprints, ivory scans, dynamic biometrics like keystrokes, right?
1814000	1816000	Voice prints, et cetera.
1816000	1819000	But, and we'll talk about biometrics in more detail.
1819000	1825000	But the biggest problem with biometrics is revocation.
1825000	1834000	Meaning if somebody, you know, if somebody's fingerprints were hijacked or somebody's keyboard patterns can be replicated, right?
1834000	1836000	By a pod.
1836000	1839000	How do you revolve it?
1839000	1840000	Right?
1840000	1841000	How do you stop it?
1841000	1844000	Because biometric is not something that can change, right?
1844000	1847000	You're not going to suddenly change the way you type.
1847000	1848000	You cannot change your DNA.
1848000	1849000	Right?
1849000	1852000	We have genomic-based authentication.
1852000	1853000	You cannot change your irises.
1853000	1857000	Certainly you don't want to change your, you can change your fingerprints, but why?
1857000	1858000	Let him out.
1858000	1859000	I hope there's not a toilet here.
1859000	1873000	Sometimes they put on, do unfortunate things like a bread bowl, there's a staff room with like coffee.
1873000	1878000	And when you're there, it's next to it, on the other side of the wall is a toilet.
1878000	1882000	So, every time somebody flushes, even if it unrolls toilet paper, you hear it, it's like, why?
1882000	1883000	Why did they do this?
1883000	1886000	I mean, it's really not pleasant.
1886000	1894000	So, anyway, so the other possibility, so we'll talk about biometrics, but the other possibility is graphical passwords.
1894000	1896000	Like image-based passwords.
1896000	1897000	Okay?
1897000	1903000	And so, maybe you have to strengthen things, right?
1903000	1907000	So, one example is what's called image recognition.
1907000	1920000	Because the idea is that we humans are kind of better, like this used to be much more true before than it is today, but we are generally better at recognizing images than bots or than computer programs.
1920000	1922000	Right?
1922000	1936000	So, one possibility is to say, okay, let's say the user's password or equivalent of a password is a sequence of images.
1936000	1941000	Or a set, nothing in the sequence, a set of images.
1941000	1947000	And there are many images we can show the user, but the user has to pick the right set.
1947000	1951000	You kind of know what I'm saying?
1951000	1964000	So, instead of memorizing something explicit to enter, you are asked to select a set of images that essentially are your passwords.
1964000	1968000	But you are selecting them from a large set.
1968000	1969000	Okay?
1969000	1971000	A large enough set.
1971000	1972000	Right?
1972000	1982000	And so, the idea is that, you know, yeah, you might think authenticity is similar to showing you a pinpad and you selecting the right digits.
1982000	1983000	But you have to remember those digits.
1983000	1986000	But you have to remember those digits where with images you are recognizing.
1986000	1987000	Right?
1987000	1989000	Rather remember you are recognizing.
1989000	2005000	So, the motivation behind this is that it's difficult to mount dictionary attack on images.
2005000	2006000	Right?
2006000	2014000	Because they don't follow the same pattern as, let's say, human memory does when we're selecting, or human mind does when selecting passwords of him.
2014000	2015000	Okay?
2015000	2024000	Of course, images are not random, but some people like to believe they are.
2024000	2030000	The one problem with images right away, if you use images for authentication, is that you cannot use very simple devices.
2030000	2031000	Right?
2031000	2035000	Something like a smartphone is going to be a challenge.
2035000	2036000	Right?
2036000	2049000	So, this is already not particularly good for, like, limited real estate devices.
2049000	2052000	But for a tablet or a laptop, this is probably okay.
2052000	2053000	Right?
2053000	2060000	So, let's think about, like, how would you use a graphical password on a tablet, laptop, desktop type of device.
2060000	2061000	Alright?
2061000	2071000	Also, we need to think about shoulder surfing, because when somebody picks images, right, those picks are kind of visible, right?
2071000	2072000	Obviously, right?
2072000	2075000	Because they have to, like, click on them or somehow select them.
2075000	2081000	Well, wouldn't displaying images reveal information because you know one of the images you selected at least has to be there?
2081000	2083000	And so, if you just try to log in...
2083000	2084000	Right, right, right.
2084000	2085000	Okay, okay.
2085000	2086000	So, let me give you a general idea.
2086000	2087000	Let me give you a general idea.
2087000	2088000	I mean, we'll go in this video.
2088000	2099000	So, suppose I display to you on your laptop screen 12 images at a time.
2099000	2101000	One of them means something to you.
2101000	2102000	The others don't.
2102000	2104000	You pick one.
2104000	2107000	I display a second screen, 12 images.
2107000	2109000	One of them means something to you.
2109000	2110000	The others don't.
2110000	2111000	Click.
2111000	2115000	I display the third, the fourth.
2115000	2118000	So, that's what we do four times.
2118000	2119000	Right.
2119000	2123000	But if you need to have, like, hundreds of thousands of these images to be secured, then...
2123000	2124000	Well, no, no, no.
2124000	2125000	Not secured.
2125000	2131000	The point is that the equivalent of a password here would be the combination, the exact combination.
2131000	2134000	The one from the first screen, one from the second screen.
2134000	2135000	Okay.
2135000	2136000	So, how many?
2136000	2139000	Well, there is like 12 to the power of four, right?
2139000	2140000	10,000.
2140000	2141000	Combinations.
2141000	2144000	Just repeat it over and over again.
2144000	2145000	Like, remove the...
2145000	2146000	Regenerate the...
2146000	2147000	No, no, no.
2147000	2151000	See, the idea is that there always has to be an image that is...
2151000	2152000	Exactly.
2152000	2153000	Yeah, exactly.
2153000	2154000	Yeah.
2154000	2155000	Which one that repeats?
2155000	2156000	Which one is always there, right?
2156000	2157000	Okay.
2157000	2158000	You're going way ahead.
2158000	2159000	Right.
2159000	2160000	You're getting ahead.
2160000	2161000	Exactly.
2161000	2162000	Exactly.
2162000	2163000	So, now I'm just starting to think, like, paranoia, right?
2163000	2165000	A little bit of suspicion.
2165000	2166000	That's how security people do.
2166000	2168000	But the idea was like this.
2168000	2174000	I'm just telling you this because this is what people try to replace password, replace password.
2174000	2182000	And the moral of the story at the end, which I'm going to jump to anyway, is passwords are here to stay for a reason.
2182000	2188000	Because not for the lack of trying to replace them with something.
2188000	2189000	So, here's an example.
2189000	2190000	It's called past faces.
2190000	2195000	And at one point, it was like a really popular thing.
2195000	2201000	And so, and from this quote, you can see where it's going.
2201000	2208000	It's a beautiful solution, but it's completely wrong.
2208000	2210000	And so, this is like the pitch.
2210000	2216000	The pitch is, you are really good, you humans, you know, are really good at recognizing faces.
2216000	2217000	Right?
2217000	2222000	They really mean something to you.
2222000	2224000	It's really like a decision problem, right?
2224000	2229000	So, you know, in computational complexity, there are computation problems and decision problems.
2229000	2230000	Yeah?
2230000	2234000	Remember this from complexity or algorithms?
2234000	2239000	Well, recognition is a decision problem that your brain goes through.
2239000	2242000	Do I know this space or do I not know this space?
2242000	2243000	Okay?
2243000	2252000	So, a password is a computation problem, meaning that you have to fetch it from the storage somewhere in your brain.
2252000	2259000	Whereas that recognition is a decision problem.
2259000	2267000	So, for us, clearly, this is absolutely true, that it's easier to recognize a face than to remember a password.
2267000	2268000	Okay?
2268000	2276000	Of course, let's forget for a second, people with severe eyesight issues or blind people.
2276000	2277000	Okay?
2277000	2281000	That's not, of course, universal.
2281000	2282000	Okay?
2282000	2292000	But then passwords for people with no hands or, you know, malformed fingers are also different.
2292000	2295000	So, again, this is like a marketing pitch.
2295000	2296000	Never forget a face.
2296000	2297000	Alright?
2297000	2299000	So, let's skip to this.
2299000	2313000	So, the idea is a user will be enrolled into a system that will show them, like a training exercise, a set of faces.
2313000	2320000	And they will be assigned a set of, let's say, six faces and repeatedly trained on recognizing those faces.
2320000	2332000	Presumably within some time limit, like 30 minutes, 20 minutes, they will be given exercises to recognize those five, six faces that they're assigned to them.
2332000	2333000	Yeah?
2333000	2348000	Then, after enrollment, whenever they want to log in, they will be shown sequences of these kind of vignettes, like 12 at a time, 10 at a time, and ask to pick a face that is one of theirs.
2348000	2350000	Okay?
2350000	2352000	That's the main idea.
2352000	2353000	Okay?
2353000	2360000	So, you have a library, but you must have, of course, a big library of faces.
2360000	2362000	But that's easy, right?
2362000	2366000	You just collect, it's easy to collect a big library of black faces.
2366000	2375000	You can have different ages, genders, facial growth, hairstyles, all kinds of people, different races.
2375000	2382000	And then, there is a user interface, where users are initially assigned, in this example, five faces.
2382000	2384000	Okay?
2384000	2393000	And, each of the five faces is associated with decoys, right?
2393000	2402000	So, when you're trained, you see the blonde, over there, with bangs, that's your face.
2402000	2406000	This guy, smiling guy, over there in the middle is your face.
2406000	2409000	This lady is your face, et cetera, et cetera.
2409000	2414000	So, these are five faces that are supposed to be for you to remember.
2414000	2415000	Okay?
2415000	2424000	And now, every time you log in, you are shown a sequence of this, and this, and this, and this, and this.
2424000	2427000	And you must select, and maybe, maybe this is a different order, maybe in a different order.
2427000	2428000	The order doesn't matter.
2428000	2430000	The order could be perturbed.
2430000	2431000	Right?
2431000	2434000	You can show this first, and that, and this.
2434000	2439000	The thing is, you remember, you're supposed to remember the faces that are associated with you.
2439000	2443000	So, it's the same set of eight faces at the time.
2443000	2447000	Now, it's the same set of eight, but this might appear here.
2447000	2448000	Right?
2448000	2455000	So, the order of these five screens would change.
2455000	2456000	Right?
2456000	2457000	This can be random.
2457000	2464000	And the placement of your face within each screen will change too.
2464000	2465000	Okay?
2465000	2472000	So, on a given screen that you're shown with, in this case, nine faces, one of them is yours.
2472000	2475000	Its position is random.
2475000	2485000	So, this is the original enrollment, familiarization process, blah, blah, blah.
2485000	2493000	And so, the claim is that once you memorize, it's like there's a cookie in your brain.
2493000	2497000	Like a web cookie, you know, browser cookie.
2497000	2500000	That helps you recognize that.
2500000	2503000	And maybe, indeed, that's how the brain works.
2503000	2508000	I mean, like we, I think there's actually a cookie, but there is something, some state information
2508000	2510000	that's stored in your brain.
2510000	2514000	It's like when you see the same, like, character actor in the movie, in several movies.
2514000	2515000	Right?
2515000	2516000	You kind of recognize them again.
2516000	2518000	You might not remember their face.
2518000	2519000	Sorry.
2519000	2520000	You might not remember their name.
2520000	2521000	Right?
2521000	2524000	Because, you know, many character actors, but you recognize them.
2524000	2525000	So, this is what's called cognometrics.
2525000	2526000	Right?
2526000	2537000	Biometrics is cognometrics, because you're not using any innate property of yourself as a human.
2537000	2539000	You're using your recognition capabilities.
2539000	2545000	And this was, believe it or not, this was really popular for a while.
2545000	2550000	It really, like, the company that came up with it, they were, like, riding super hot.
2550000	2552000	It was one of those unicorn stars.
2552000	2559000	So, there's two variations, and you can think already which one is better.
2559000	2564000	There's variations where the system assigns you faces, like the one you just saw.
2564000	2569000	And there's another variation where the user picks faces.
2569000	2575000	Like, you're given, like, a vignette of, like, nine, and you say, I like this face.
2575000	2578000	And another vignette of nine, and you pick another face.
2578000	2579000	Okay?
2579000	2584000	Now, presumably, a user will pick faces they can remember better, right?
2584000	2589000	So, there's less training.
2589000	2596000	Now, a third possibility you can imagine where the user uploads their own faces.
2596000	2599000	Now, they didn't know for this.
2599000	2602000	Anybody can see why?
2602000	2607000	Because if somebody mounts an attack, a dictionary attack, right?
2607000	2610000	Or, sort of, an attack on somebody's fast pace.
2610000	2614000	And they know that the system allows them to upload their own photos.
2614000	2619000	Well, they're probably likely to know who are your friends, relatives, etc.
2619000	2620000	Right?
2620000	2621000	Right?
2621000	2622000	So, do you have treatment?
2622000	2623000	So, that's why that was not offered, right?
2623000	2625000	Where a user uploads their own photos.
2625000	2627000	Also, by highlighting.
2627000	2629000	That is also true, right?
2629000	2636000	So, yeah, of course, you can deal with that by varying lighting and so on, and, you know, reducing green light, increasing green light.
2636000	2638000	But, they didn't offer that.
2638000	2646000	Then, a bunch of people at, some researchers at John Plotkin's, and CMU, did a study of this.
2646000	2649000	And, this is, which brought the whole house and cars down.
2649000	2654000	They studied the user-selected fast pace variant.
2654000	2658000	Because, the system-selected one turned out not to be very practical.
2658000	2660000	People were just forgetting faces.
2660000	2661000	Right?
2661000	2663000	The user-selected one worked better.
2663000	2667000	When I say user-selected, it's the second one.
2667000	2668000	Right?
2668000	2679000	The conclusion was, that people tend to pick very biased faces.
2679000	2680000	Right?
2680000	2685000	The race and gender, or ethnicity and gender, have a lot to do with it.
2685000	2690000	Is that any of the surprising?
2690000	2692000	That's how we are.
2692000	2694000	That's how we operate.
2694000	2695000	Right?
2695000	2699000	And, particularly, it was, it was particularly bad for male students.
2699000	2701000	But, they didn't experiment on students.
2701000	2704000	So, keep that in mind, it's a specific preparation.
2704000	2705000	Right?
2705000	2714000	So, meaning two guesses of faces were enough for most, sorry, for 10% of male users, and eight guesses were enough for a quarter.
2714000	2716000	To basically get their fast faces.
2716000	2719000	Because, they would just pick, I don't know, the prettiest girls.
2719000	2720000	Yeah.
2720000	2723000	And, in fact, yeah?
2723000	2729000	Then, why not show all the particular in the same row, and then choose the only one level?
2729000	2731000	Because, they were simply not enough.
2731000	2732000	Right?
2732000	2733000	You have to mix in others.
2733000	2734000	Yeah.
2734000	2736000	But, I mean, I actually don't know the reasoning.
2736000	2742000	But, they would always consist, I mean, they tended to pick a very predictable kind of a face.
2742000	2759000	So, in the end, the system should probably pick, for security purposes, it's better for the system to pick faces for users than for users to pick faces.
2759000	2765000	Because, users will always exercise some bias, depending on their characteristics.
2765000	2770000	But, if the system picks faces, then you have a high error rate, and that's what they've observed.
2770000	2773000	Also, some people have what is called dyspagia.
2773000	2777000	It's a condition where they are unable to recognize faces.
2777000	2782000	There's a small percentage of humans all over the world that have this condition.
2782000	2791000	There is a book by a neuroscientist called, A Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.
2791000	2796000	And, he talks about, you know, patients that have that issue.
2796000	2797000	How's it?
2797000	2798000	Personal technology.
2798000	2799000	Personal technology.
2799000	2800000	Personal, okay.
2800000	2801000	There you go.
2801000	2802000	Yeah.
2802000	2803000	Personal technology.
2803000	2806000	It's rare, but it's not completely unknown.
2806000	2808000	Also, you need these displays.
2808000	2810000	So, this is not good enough for smartphones.
2810000	2813000	It was supposed to be good enough for, like, laptops, desks.
2813000	2821000	And also, last but not least, changing a set of faces is really hard.
2821000	2822000	It's harder than past ones.
2822000	2823000	Okay?
2823000	2824000	It really is hard.
2824000	2825000	Now, think about why this is.
2825000	2826000	This was also studied.
2826000	2837000	Because, all these, you know, like, old faces, they're still here.
2837000	2842000	So, you cannot erase the cookies from your brain.
2842000	2848000	The past faces that, say, you used in last year, are still in your brain.
2848000	2853000	And, when you change, on January 1st, a new set of past faces, you will have a really hard
2853000	2856000	time remembering which ones are from each.
2856000	2865000	So, that was like, I think, a final nail in the coffin of this method.
2865000	2867000	Now, shoulder surfing.
2867000	2874000	Generally, graphical passwords, as are unlocked patterns, are more vulnerable to shoulder surfing.
2874000	2875000	Okay?
2875000	2886000	Because, selecting pictures, right, recognizable pictures, is just more visible.
2886000	2888000	And, also, it takes time, right?
2888000	2892000	So, with a password, if you do remember the password, it doesn't take the past.
2892000	2893000	It didn't take the past.
2893000	2896000	The recognition takes longer.
2896000	2901000	Because, you're going to see, let's say, in the example I showed, you'll see a small,
2901000	2905000	I mean, a screen with nine photos.
2905000	2912000	And, the position of the person's face, that is part of your past face, password, is going
2912000	2913000	to change.
2913000	2917000	So, your eyes have to go around, like, and find that face.
2917000	2921000	That takes longer, and that means it's easier to shoulder surfing.
2921000	2928000	So, there was an experiment done, a shoulder surfing experiment at the University of Maryland,
2928000	2933000	in Baltimore County, where people were using two types of passwords.
2933000	2934000	Pass faces with a mouse.
2934000	2936000	That's saying pass faces with a mouse.
2936000	2942000	Mouse means, yeah, you mouse over the face that you recognize, click.
2942000	2949000	Then, there's pass faces with a keyboard, where you basically use the arrow keys to move.
2949000	2952000	Dictionary text passwords is a normal password.
2952000	2957000	Non-dictionary text passwords with random words and numbers.
2957000	2962000	And, the result was, actually, non-dictionary text passwords was the worst.
2962000	2966000	That is, the best for shoulder surfing, but the worst for the users.
2966000	2969000	And, maybe you can tell me why that is.
2969000	2975000	Because, when you're typing non-dictionary text, you're kind of typed slower, because it's not a word, and...
2975000	2978000	It's not a word, and it's like...
2978000	2979000	Yeah, yeah.
2979000	2981000	Getting your fingers moving in really weird ways.
2981000	2982000	That's right.
2982000	2985000	So, that really is the only reason.
2985000	2987000	The only reason.
2987000	2997000	Now, one of the things that has been used, one of the techniques that has been used for pin entry,
2997000	3004000	that has been relatively successful, but it's really terrible for shoulder surfing, is this.
3004000	3006000	Maybe some of you have encountered it.
3006000	3007000	Yeah.
3007000	3011000	So, normally, you enter a pin by just typing in the number, right?
3011000	3015000	Anybody's ever seen other ways of entering a pin?
3015000	3020000	Okay, so...
3020000	3022000	Let me see if I...
3022000	3024000	I'm not sure what you're saying, but like...
3024000	3028000	Instead of being one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
3028000	3029000	Oh, oh, oh, right.
3029000	3030000	Scramble keypad, right?
3030000	3031000	Scramble keypad.
3031000	3032000	Okay.
3032000	3033000	Yeah.
3033000	3034000	On the screen.
3034000	3035000	On the screen.
3035000	3036000	On the screen.
3036000	3037000	On the screen.
3037000	3038000	Yes, I've seen those.
3038000	3039000	Not recently.
3039000	3040000	Does anybody see why?
3040000	3041000	Well, it slows you down.
3041000	3042000	Which is really bad for shoulder surfing.
3042000	3043000	But why do they do it?
3043000	3046000	Well, I guess that fixes the smudging problem.
3046000	3048000	Well, there's no smudging because you're typing, right?
3048000	3049000	So, they're clicking.
3049000	3050000	I think it's protecting for maybe some other app in your own phone.
3050000	3051000	Yes.
3051000	3060000	It's trying to protect from somebody, like, looking which part of the screen you type.
3060000	3064000	So, if there's some malicious program, whether it's on a smartphone or an air or an computer,
3064000	3065000	it's trying to protect from somebody, like, looking which part of the screen you type.
3065000	3080000	So, if there's some malicious program, whether it's on a smartphone or an air or a computer,
3080000	3084000	it's looking what part of the screen was clicked, they won't know.
3084000	3086000	They won't know, right?
3086000	3091000	We will know if the layout of the pin path is constant.
3091000	3093000	But if it varies, they won't know, right?
3093000	3096000	But the way that I was talking about is different.
3096000	3105000	Suppose that instead of entering the pin, what you have to do is use arrow keys to adjust a random number to your pin.
3105000	3109000	Has anybody seen that?
3109000	3118000	So, you're displaying a pin, which is some, let's say it's four digits, right?
3118000	3124000	You're displaying a 7, 9, 2, 5.
3124000	3133000	And your pin is actually 8, 1, 3, 7.
3133000	3134000	Right?
3134000	3136000	This is your pin.
3136000	3139000	But the number you see on the screen is this.
3139000	3147000	So, what you do is you use an arrow key once, then you sideways arrow key, right?
3147000	3163000	Sideways arrow key, then down 8, 8 clicks down, sideways, 1 click up, sideways, 2 clicks up.
3163000	3166000	Do you follow what I'm saying?
3166000	3174000	You essentially take a random number and adjust it to your pin.
3174000	3179000	Really terrible for shoulder surfing, because at the end of this, what will be displayed?
3179000	3181000	Your pin.
3181000	3182000	Right?
3182000	3186000	Because you're adjusting a random number to the pin, yes?
3186000	3189000	But what is it good for?
3189000	3191000	The entry is never the same.
3191000	3207000	The entry is never the same, and if there's a keyboard sniffer, a key logger, or a person in another room with a microphone listening to the clicks, what are they going to hear?
3207000	3208000	Different sequence.
3208000	3210000	Different sequence every time.
3210000	3211000	Different sequence.
3211000	3214000	Different sequence every time.
3214000	3215000	Don't make yourself puzzled.
3215000	3216000	Look at, look, look.
3216000	3221000	It's really an excellent method when somebody cannot look at your screen.
3221000	3222000	Right?
3222000	3243000	If the adversary is eavesdropping acoustically, or the adversary is recording the keystrokes, like because they planted some malicious driver on their keyboard, or some app that gets privileges to actually record the keystrokes, this method is excellent.
3243000	3248000	The problem is, it does display your pin in the end.
3248000	3253000	So if somebody is also looking at the screen, it does.
3253000	3263000	Right, so, if you want to read more about it, there's a nice article titled, Why Are We All Such Idiots?
3263000	3266000	And it tells you about password ticks.
3266000	3270000	This is Maurice, well, Maurice, like nine years old.
3270000	3275000	Now, let's look at biometrics for a sec.
3275000	3281000	Biometric authentication is, on the surface, kind of nice.
3281000	3283000	There's nothing to remember.
3283000	3286000	Absolutely nothing to remember with biometrics.
3286000	3291000	I mean, other than like, this is my finger, this is my face.
3291000	3297000	So, as long as you remember where your face is and where your fingers are, you're okay.
3297000	3301000	There's nothing to compute, generally, right?
3301000	3302000	With biometrics.
3302000	3306000	There's no device to carry around for you, right?
3306000	3313000	Now, okay, yes, phone is a device you do carry around, but in prior time, right?
3313000	3315000	Phones are not an issue, right?
3315000	3317000	If you wanted to get access to a system, right?
3317000	3322000	A mainframe computer or network, or enter a building, and it was protected by biometrics,
3322000	3325000	there's nothing you need to carry around, right?
3325000	3329000	Today, if the phone is what you want to get into, and you use a biometrics,
3329000	3331000	you don't have to carry around anything additional.
3331000	3333000	All right.
3333000	3336000	Biometrics cannot be shared.
3336000	3337000	That's the other problem.
3337000	3339000	A lot of people who share passwords.
3339000	3343000	Like, let's say, all the streaming sites, right?
3343000	3346000	How many of you share passwords on your streaming site?
3346000	3350000	I bet all of you do, right?
3350000	3355000	I mean, I personally mooch off my kids, you know?
3355000	3359000	I mean, I paid enough for them, now they can pay for my streaming pleasures.
3359000	3363000	So, yeah, we share pins, we share passwords.
3363000	3367000	If we need to have biometrics, you cannot share, right?
3367000	3368000	You can't, right?
3368000	3371000	It's just fundamentally shouldn't be possible.
3371000	3373000	Which is good, right?
3373000	3379000	So, imagine, I'm not hoping this will happen, but I wouldn't be surprised if next year Netflix
3379000	3382000	says, oh, you know, you want to use your Netflix account?
3382000	3386000	Well, stick your eyes in here, or come close to the camera, or like, you know,
3386000	3391000	look at your face, or face unlock with your phone, and it will give you a code, right?
3391000	3393000	So, something like that.
3393000	3397000	Can be pretty unique, right?
3397000	3400000	It's not always unique.
3400000	3406000	Not all biometrics are good enough, but, and they do vary quite a bit, but generally, they
3406000	3410000	can be made sufficiently accurate.
3410000	3416000	But the problems right away with biometrics is that they offer two things.
3416000	3423000	One is identification, which is associating an identity, right, with some action or data,
3423000	3424000	right?
3424000	3428000	Like a, like forensically finding a fingerprint in a crime scene, right?
3428000	3431000	That's identifying a criminal, right?
3431000	3438000	And authentication is verifying an identity, like verifying that you are here right now.
3438000	3441000	Do you see the difference?
3441000	3444000	Verification of live identity, right?
3444000	3446000	You are here right now.
3446000	3449000	Like when your phone looks at your face, right?
3449000	3452000	It's like, you are here right now.
3452000	3455000	Not you were here before, right?
3455000	3457000	But you are here right now.
3457000	3462000	That's authentication.
3462000	3470000	The difficulty of forgery is difficult to estimate, because it varies from biometric to biometric.
3470000	3473000	But it's usually overestimate.
3473000	3478000	There are computer generated forgeries.
3478000	3482000	There are also, with 3D printers, things become very interesting.
3482000	3485000	For example, fingerprints, right?
3485000	3495000	You can actually take somebody's fingerprint and easily, well, if you have access to a 3D printer, print a finger.
3495000	3507000	Just a disconnected thing that has a cushiony, human-like skin-cut feel, and perfectly replicates everything in the finger.
3507000	3516000	I mean, in the same way, you could also print somebody's face in 3D.
3516000	3519000	What is difficult to do in 3D is to make it live.
3519000	3522000	And you have it moving, right?
3522000	3525000	Have the lips moving, nose moving, et cetera.
3525000	3533000	But just to print the face, and that would fool some of the, maybe not current, but earlier face recognition.
3533000	3534000	Unlocks it.
3534000	3535000	It's totally doable.
3535000	3540000	And it's been demonstrated.
3540000	3544000	As I said before, revocation of biometrics is really hard.
3544000	3547000	And you need an infrastructure.
3547000	3548000	Right?
3548000	3555000	If you have a biometric based authentication in a company, let's say, on a company brand.
3555000	3558000	Anybody ever work for a company that uses biometrics?
3558000	3559000	No?
3559000	3560000	Hmm.
3560000	3561000	Thank you.
3561000	3562000	There's somebody else.
3562000	3563000	You did?
3563000	3564000	No.
3564000	3565000	What kind of admin?
3565000	3566000	We did fingerprints.
3566000	3567000	Fingerprints.
3567000	3569000	Well, so, that means readers, right?
3569000	3580000	So, it wasn't like you could come to the badge reader at the door of the company, put your phone there, and then unlock your phone, and it will let you know.
3580000	3581000	Right?
3581000	3585000	So, my guess is you have to put your finger on their fingerprint reader, right?
3585000	3588000	And so, every door had to be protected through the fingerprint.
3588000	3590000	That implies infrastructure.
3590000	3591000	Right?
3591000	3594000	It also implies enrollment.
3594000	3603000	And enrollment is what all of you go through when you do the first, when you get a new phone and you do the face unlock enrollment or fingerprint enrollment.
3603000	3606000	Now, face unlock enrollment is not that difficult, right?
3606000	3607000	How long does it take for you?
3607000	3609000	Give me an info card.
3609000	3612000	That's reasonably fast.
3612000	3614000	Anybody who took long?
3616000	3617000	A minute.
3617000	3618000	A minute.
3618000	3619000	Okay.
3619000	3620000	So, let's say a minute.
3620000	3621000	It's not a big deal these days, right?
3621000	3624000	Anybody remember doing fingerprint enrollment?
3624000	3626000	That took a long time.
3626000	3627000	It's annoying.
3627000	3628000	Right?
3628000	3632000	Because sometimes it will not take your finger because you're going to put it the right way, right?
3632000	3634000	That was very annoying.
3634000	3637000	I mean, my previous phone had fingerprint enrollment.
3637000	3640000	And also, well, I had high error rates.
3640000	3643000	If my finger was wet, it wouldn't work.
3643000	3648000	If my finger was dry, very dry, I had chalk on it, it wouldn't work.
3648000	3649000	So, it was okay.
3649000	3650000	Faces are better.
3650000	3654000	Anyway, but the point here is you need infrastructure, right?
3654000	3657000	So, forget, here we're used to this, right?
3657000	3658000	Unlocking this.
3658000	3659000	This is easy.
3659000	3663000	There's not a lot of infrastructure other than the camera to do face unlock.
3663000	3664000	Right?
3664000	3667000	And some software, some fancy software that actually supports it.
3667000	3668000	Right?
3668000	3670000	For fingerprint, the same even less, right?
3670000	3672000	Well, now they don't even have to.
3672000	3678000	But, if you want to do it on an enterprise-wide basis, that's an expensive investment.
3678000	3683000	You need to actually have all the device input devices, right?
3683000	3685000	For people through or for fingerprint.
3685000	3686000	Right?
3686000	3689000	It must have all these other programs.
3689000	3690000	This is more formal.
3690000	3691000	Right?
3691000	3693000	You need to consider using biometrics.
3693000	3694000	It has to be universal.
3694000	3695000	Right?
3695000	3697000	It has to be usable by most people.
3697000	3702000	So, if you suggest a biometric that only works for people with white skin, that isn't
3702000	3703000	good.
3703000	3709000	Or, if you suggest a biometric that only is usable for people who are right-handed, that's
3709000	3710000	not going to work.
3710000	3711000	Right?
3711000	3716000	Now, if you say, well, sorry, my biometric does not work for mute people.
3716000	3721000	Okay, it's not nice, but it's probably reasonably acceptable.
3721000	3724000	So, you have to make sure it's as universal as possible.
3724000	3725000	Unique.
3725000	3728000	There must be sufficient degree of distinction.
3728000	3733000	So, one biometric that has been proposed in the past is gait.
3733000	3736000	Gait is the way you walk.
3736000	3738000	Okay?
3738000	3743000	Turns out, most people walk in a very particular way.
3743000	3746000	Is it unique?
3746000	3747000	No.
3747000	3754000	There's other problems, but among other things, it's not unique.
3754000	3755000	Permanence.
3755000	3758000	This is consistency over time.
3758000	3762000	Does the biometric stay the same, or does it change?
3762000	3765000	For example, your genome stays the same.
3765000	3766000	Does your face stay the same?
3766000	3767000	Hmm?
3767000	3768000	Hmm?
3768000	3769000	Hmm?
3769000	3770000	Hmm?
3770000	3771000	Hmm?
3771000	3772000	Hmm?
3772000	3773000	Not certain, right?
3773000	3774000	Not certain.
3774000	3775000	What about your fingerprints?
3775000	3782000	Yeah, your fingerprints stay the same as long as you don't cut them off or, you know,
3782000	3785000	have a certain skin condition.
3785000	3786000	Eczema.
3786000	3793000	But otherwise, the generally stays the same.
3793000	3794000	Unobtrusiveness.
3794000	3797000	Does it disrupt the normal flow?
3797000	3803000	Well, if you tell me that before I enter the building I need to walk three times like
3803000	3808000	this in front of the door, there's going to be a large queue and I'm going to be very annoying.
3808000	3811000	So, it's definitely obtrusive, right?
3811000	3815000	So, unobtrusiveness is fine, right?
3815000	3818000	Maybe a fingerprint is not very obtrusive.
3818000	3822000	A face is reasonably not very obtrusive, right?
3822000	3824000	You're used to it now with TSA, right?
3824000	3826000	When you go to the airport.
3826000	3829000	Increasingly, they're starting to use face recognition.
3829000	3830000	Right?
3830000	3834000	They don't even ask you, some of the places don't even ask you for a boarding pass anymore.
3834000	3836000	Have you seen that?
3836000	3840000	I've encountered several times in the last six to eight months.
3840000	3842000	And they don't ask you for a boarding pass.
3842000	3845000	You just do a face recognition piece.
3845000	3847000	Circumvention difficulty.
3847000	3851000	It should be hard to impersonate others, but that relates to uniqueness.
3851000	3854000	Equipment cost, right?
3854000	3858000	It cannot cost an arm in a lab.
3858000	3861000	And easy enrollment things.
3861000	3864000	Or how difficult it is to enroll people in that boundary.
3864000	3868000	Enrolling people in something like a handwriting biometric.
3868000	3869000	Right?
3869000	3873000	Where they recognize your handwriting, but that's pretty time-fixing.
3873000	3876000	Enrolling in face biometrics, as you said, is not difficult.
3876000	3887000	There is in biometrics something called fraud rate, or basically a false positive.
3887000	3890000	Everybody familiar, I'm sure, with fraud positive?
3890000	3891000	Right?
3891000	3892000	And the insult rate.
3892000	3893000	Yeah.
3893000	3894000	That's an old term.
3894000	3895000	It means a false negative.
3895000	3896000	Right?
3896000	3900000	False negative means the system says, yeah, go away.
3900000	3901000	I don't know you.
3901000	3902000	Right?
3902000	3903000	That's an insult.
3903000	3904000	Right?
3904000	3905000	To the customer, right?
3905000	3906000	That's a false insult to me.
3906000	3910000	So, some companies that use biometrics, like banks, they're very, very concerned about insults.
3910000	3911000	Right?
3911000	3914000	Because they want to piss off the customer.
3914000	3917000	The government doesn't care.
3917000	3920000	They don't care about the insult.
3920000	3921000	Right?
3921000	3923000	So, fraud rate is false positive.
3923000	3924000	Right?
3924000	3928000	That is, how can you, the circumvention of biometrics, how is it to circumvent?
3928000	3933000	In some cases, how is it to mistakenly not recognize somebody?
3933000	3934000	Right?
3934000	3937000	So, usually they are like interdependent, like a seesaw.
3937000	3942000	We increase one, the other one goes down, and the other way around.
3946000	3953000	For face recognition, today, this has been a big, a big jump in efficacy.
3953000	3959000	But today, the error rates tend to be around 1% for face recognition.
3959000	3962000	That's for the best face recognition algorithms today.
3962000	3965000	Or just even under 1%.
3965000	3972000	And this is down from like 5% 10 years ago, and 20% 15 years ago.
3972000	3975000	So, there's been some amazing progress in face recognition.
3975000	3978000	Doesn't mean that's going to be your experience with your smartphone.
3978000	3982000	Because you're not running the fastest, the most advanced face recognition.
3982000	3987000	Just because your smartphone isn't capable of doing, you know, that much computation.
3987000	3991000	But, have you noticed that over time, the face recognition improved?
3991000	3993000	Especially with iPhones.
3993000	3998000	I mean, I'm not a fan of iPhones, but I found that iPhone face recognition is pretty good.
3998000	4002000	Like, I rarely have issues.
4002000	4007000	Whereas before, when I used the early Android face recognition, it was terrible.
4007000	4013000	Any kind of shadow, any kind of a hat, anything like that would throw it off.
4013000	4015000	And fingerprints were just horrific.
4015000	4017000	They were super annoying.
4017000	4023000	But fingerprints have been around for a long time.
4023000	4024000	Oh, sorry.
4024000	4029000	If you use weak hardware, like if you use IoT devices that use face recognition,
4029000	4033000	then the error rates will go up to like 40 or so.
4033000	4037000	So that's not very good.
4037000	4038000	Also, consider this.
4038000	4039000	Injuries, right?
4039000	4043000	You have a, you know, you run into a wall or something.
4043000	4049000	So, you know, you get into a fight, you know, part of your face like swells up.
4049000	4052000	That influences face recognition a lot.
4052000	4055000	Hair, shouldn't, right?
4055000	4059000	The really good algorithms, they don't, facial hair does not sway them,
4059000	4062000	but the cheaper algorithms, the faster algorithms do.
4062000	4068000	Medicines, drugs that alter, sometimes you'll have like bags under your eyes
4068000	4075000	or any kind of like things that, side effects of illegal drugs or just regular pharmaceutical medicine.
4075000	4079000	Plastic surgery clearly will alter your face, right?
4079000	4087000	So that's even something like a small nose job or a, what do you call it?
4087000	4091000	Lip injections can cause lack of recognition.
4091000	4095000	Acne, your acne will also cause problems.
4095000	4099000	So facial recognition has still some challenges.
4099000	4103000	Now, fingerprints were really popular before, right?
4103000	4106000	They've been used since like actually 19th century.
4106000	4112000	They were sort of, the whole process started in criminology in France, I think, in the 19th century.
4112000	4116000	But the US, the first conviction was in 1911 based on fingerprint evidence.
4116000	4119000	So there's a lot of science behind using fingerprints.
4119000	4124000	I mean, they're used today for crime scenes, identification, right, et cetera.
4124000	4129000	They're reasonably unique, right?
4129000	4135000	If you get an actual fingerprint, right, a full fingerprint, they're really unique.
4135000	4139000	The probability of collision is like 1 in 10 billion, maybe even less today.
4139000	4145000	The problem is, well, generally fingerprints don't change, right?
4145000	4149000	Unlike with the face, they don't change with time, right?
4149000	4156000	So a child's fingerprint is still going to have the same patterns and the same person when they are an adult.
4156000	4162000	The finger size, the fingertip size will grow, but the patterns will stay.
4162000	4171000	So it will grow proportionally, which means that modern fingerprint algorithms can accommodate, let's say, a teenager or a tween,
4171000	4176000	who are still going to grow, but the algorithm will still recognize their finger.
4176000	4183000	But eczema and, you know, scars and missing fingers, of course, indeed, lead up.
4183000	4187000	I think we are, oh, time to be done, yeah?
4187000	4188000	Yeah?
4188000	4191000	Is that 1 in 10 billion genetically, or...?
4191000	4193000	No, no, no, no.
4193000	4199000	I think genetically you are, I mean, in the analog world, you are unique when it's actually a fingerprint.
4199000	4209000	Now, I'm not speaking from, like, real knowledge here, but I remember reading something that, you know, you are unique, but the problem is the accuracy of it.
4209000	4211000	Taking the fingerprints, right?
4211000	4213000	That's why it's only 10 billion.
4213000	4215000	You should be good at it.
4215000	4216000	Okay.
4216000	4223000	So, again, if you have not sent me your project proposal, you need to do it to our SAP.
4223000	4226000	If I don't get it by the end of the day, you will lose points.
4226000	4228000	So, please get on the ball.
4228000	4234000	Let's just stick down the ball.
4234000	4241000	.
4243000	4244000	.
