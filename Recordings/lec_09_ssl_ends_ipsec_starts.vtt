WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
I'm Drew Zee, if you don't die, no excuses.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.220
Now, let's share a quick show of hands.

00:07.520 --> 00:11.240
Do you want me to post a few example problems?

00:11.800 --> 00:12.060
Yeah.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.640
From prior years?

00:14.260 --> 00:14.600
Yes.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.740
Let me ask this.

00:15.960 --> 00:16.960
How many don't want them?

00:20.960 --> 00:23.840
I'll throw it together, a few examples.

00:23.960 --> 00:24.900
But I won't post solutions.

00:24.900 --> 00:32.240
Because many of the type of exams I give in classes I teach

00:32.240 --> 00:35.060
generally have more than one solution.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.480
Rarely there's just one.

00:38.620 --> 00:41.080
It's like for undergrad when I teach crypto,

00:41.260 --> 00:42.240
there's just one solution.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.940
It's a numeric answer.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.960
But other than that, the type of questions you have,

00:49.960 --> 00:54.980
that will require one, maximum two paragraph answers.

00:56.340 --> 00:56.500
Okay?

00:57.040 --> 00:58.420
Do not write me an essay.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.280
Okay?

01:00.540 --> 01:00.960
Please.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.180
Save yourself, save me.

01:03.340 --> 01:04.100
Don't write an essay.

01:05.100 --> 01:05.400
Okay?

01:06.180 --> 01:09.420
Also, just as a rule,

01:10.300 --> 01:12.380
there are no devices allowed in the essay.

01:12.380 --> 01:15.440
The phones, calculators,

01:16.080 --> 01:18.620
everything that you normally bring

01:18.620 --> 01:20.700
has to be inside your backpack

01:20.700 --> 01:22.500
or somewhere else away from you.

01:23.440 --> 01:23.700
Okay?

01:24.840 --> 01:29.660
No virtual reality AR type devices like this one.

01:30.480 --> 01:30.780
Okay?

01:31.240 --> 01:32.140
No earphones.

01:32.860 --> 01:33.480
No headphones.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.080
Right?

01:35.320 --> 01:36.060
None of that.

01:37.020 --> 01:39.400
No smart devices whatsoever on your body

01:39.400 --> 01:40.720
at the time of your exam.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.960
Nice.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.200
So your backpack, whatever stuff,

01:44.380 --> 01:46.860
inside, next to you, under you, whatever.

01:47.060 --> 01:47.540
No problem.

01:48.080 --> 01:48.380
Okay?

01:48.640 --> 01:50.660
You need to bring something to write with.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.000
Pen?

01:53.660 --> 01:54.100
Pencil?

01:54.640 --> 01:54.980
Both?

01:56.580 --> 01:56.940
Sure.

01:57.940 --> 01:58.260
Okay?

01:58.680 --> 01:59.580
I will give you paper.

02:00.280 --> 02:00.660
I know.

02:00.800 --> 02:01.360
It's old-fashioned.

02:01.540 --> 02:02.340
It's 20th century.

02:03.460 --> 02:04.720
You write it on paper.

02:05.900 --> 02:06.080
Okay?

02:06.880 --> 02:08.540
I will give you an exam sheet.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.540
You will have some number of problems.

02:10.720 --> 02:11.600
Not too large.

02:11.700 --> 02:12.300
Not too small.

02:13.460 --> 02:15.500
Same rules apply to the final type.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.240
And you will have blank sheets of paper

02:19.240 --> 02:20.100
that I will bring.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.360
And I will give you a couple to start with.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.600
If you need more, you'll come up.

02:25.960 --> 02:26.600
Make some up.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.880
You can write on one side or both sides.

02:30.940 --> 02:31.380
I don't care.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.800
The only thing I absolutely care

02:34.800 --> 02:37.700
is that you do your best penmanship.

02:37.700 --> 02:42.720
I am not here to decipher encrypted text.

02:43.980 --> 02:45.340
It's not what I paid for.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.860
That's beyond my call of duty.

02:47.860 --> 02:50.720
So, if I can't read it,

02:51.020 --> 02:53.520
I'll assume it's not decipherable

02:53.520 --> 02:57.320
and it requires a deduction of points.

02:57.320 --> 03:01.120
I mean, I don't want to be calling everybody in

03:01.120 --> 03:01.420
and saying,

03:01.520 --> 03:02.440
what did you mean here?

03:02.560 --> 03:03.840
What is this encrypted word?

03:03.940 --> 03:05.480
What is it in scrambled sentence?

03:05.980 --> 03:08.280
Please, write legibly.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.540
If you have to print,

03:09.980 --> 03:11.000
use printed letters.

03:11.100 --> 03:11.520
I don't care.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.360
Just write legend.

03:14.100 --> 03:14.300
Okay?

03:15.960 --> 03:17.240
And if you erase,

03:17.840 --> 03:19.380
make sure you erase well

03:19.380 --> 03:20.700
because sometimes, you know,

03:20.740 --> 03:21.760
when you erase something,

03:22.080 --> 03:22.960
it's smudgy

03:22.960 --> 03:24.340
and then you write on top of it

03:24.340 --> 03:26.100
and then it's hard to read.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.120
I'll give you more paper.

03:28.820 --> 03:29.300
No problem.

03:30.240 --> 03:30.500
Okay?

03:30.780 --> 03:31.640
So, that's the exam

03:31.640 --> 03:33.260
and it will cover everything we covered

03:33.260 --> 03:34.560
including today.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.000
I might ask you questions

03:38.000 --> 03:39.240
about the background stuff

03:39.240 --> 03:39.660
from that,

03:39.720 --> 03:40.940
remember that lecture one background?

03:41.520 --> 03:43.360
Why, like, not specific?

03:43.540 --> 03:45.720
Like, not in big detail, right?

03:46.680 --> 03:48.480
It's not relevant to what we covered.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.800
Otherwise, so far,

03:49.920 --> 03:50.800
I won't ask you, like,

03:51.040 --> 03:54.340
how does elliptic curve DSA work?

03:57.020 --> 03:58.740
So, I'll be reasonable

03:58.740 --> 04:01.180
and you'll try to be reasonable.

04:02.560 --> 04:02.720
Yeah?

04:02.860 --> 04:03.520
Are we going to expect

04:03.520 --> 04:04.120
to know, like,

04:04.120 --> 04:04.940
the specific numbers

04:04.940 --> 04:06.200
associated with different protocols?

04:07.320 --> 04:07.980
What do you think?

04:08.600 --> 04:09.340
I don't know.

04:09.700 --> 04:10.620
I'm not happy.

04:11.000 --> 04:11.120
No.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.320
No.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.020
If I ask you something like,

04:14.140 --> 04:15.300
okay, so how does,

04:15.500 --> 04:16.540
let's say today's lecture

04:16.540 --> 04:17.980
was more about IPsec.

04:18.420 --> 04:18.900
So, I'll say,

04:19.040 --> 04:21.740
how does IPsec parse headers?

04:23.320 --> 04:24.900
You should know how it does it

04:24.900 --> 04:26.780
but you don't need to know

04:26.780 --> 04:28.040
the vertical numbers

04:28.040 --> 04:29.020
and, you know,

04:29.260 --> 04:29.860
this kind of thing.

04:29.860 --> 04:30.560
That's minutia.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.820
I don't care about that.

04:32.920 --> 04:33.700
I do not hear.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.000
You're not here to, like,

04:35.560 --> 04:36.500
for growth learning

04:36.500 --> 04:39.320
to memorize some boring numbers,

04:39.400 --> 04:39.600
you know.

04:39.600 --> 04:45.800
Okay, so, on the last episode

04:45.800 --> 04:47.220
of 203,

04:47.220 --> 04:50.840
we went for SSL-TLS

04:50.840 --> 04:52.880
and I know you're probably

04:52.880 --> 04:54.520
more confused than you were before

04:54.520 --> 04:57.320
but you do know a bit more about it

04:57.320 --> 04:58.240
than you knew before.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.280
It is a complicated protocol.

05:02.540 --> 05:04.280
Nobody learns SSL-TLS

05:04.280 --> 05:05.140
in one lecture.

05:06.100 --> 05:06.340
Okay?

05:06.740 --> 05:08.820
It's an effort that took years

05:08.820 --> 05:10.980
by a whole lot of people,

05:11.360 --> 05:12.580
smart people, right, mostly.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.440
people with degrees

05:14.440 --> 05:15.480
and experience

05:15.480 --> 05:16.880
and security experts

05:16.880 --> 05:18.760
to put together this protocol

05:18.760 --> 05:20.200
and to evolve.

05:20.940 --> 05:22.180
So, don't expect to, like,

05:22.280 --> 05:23.560
understand everything

05:23.560 --> 05:25.520
in one lecture

05:25.520 --> 05:26.280
or even two.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.320
What I give you here

05:28.320 --> 05:30.420
in almost every lecture

05:30.420 --> 05:31.820
is essentially

05:31.820 --> 05:32.880
an appetizer

05:32.880 --> 05:34.300
and if you're interested

05:34.300 --> 05:35.260
in the meal,

05:35.680 --> 05:36.420
you go further

05:36.420 --> 05:37.460
and do a dig on your own.

05:38.860 --> 05:39.160
Okay?

05:40.060 --> 05:40.900
So, you will know

05:40.900 --> 05:42.080
just enough to be dangerous.

05:42.580 --> 05:43.500
but it's not enough

05:43.500 --> 05:44.660
to be any kind of an expert.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.480
So, remember,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.200
what the key things

05:50.200 --> 05:51.240
about SSL

05:51.240 --> 05:52.760
and SSL-TLS

05:52.760 --> 05:54.200
is that they operate

05:54.200 --> 05:56.900
at this thin sublayer

05:56.900 --> 05:58.760
above transport.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.520
They are primarily oriented

06:01.520 --> 06:02.880
towards the web

06:02.880 --> 06:04.060
or HTTP traffic

06:04.060 --> 06:05.040
but not exclusively.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.200
People use SSL-TLS

06:07.200 --> 06:08.220
for other things.

06:08.980 --> 06:10.100
But the biggest consumer

06:10.100 --> 06:11.740
is the web traffic.

06:12.580 --> 06:21.200
So, we covered

06:21.200 --> 06:22.220
the handshake, right?

06:22.420 --> 06:22.760
Remember

06:22.760 --> 06:24.300
the handshake protocol?

06:24.780 --> 06:24.920
Right?

06:25.000 --> 06:25.720
That's the main

06:25.720 --> 06:28.380
thing about CLS

06:28.380 --> 06:29.340
is without the handshake

06:29.340 --> 06:30.240
nothing else works.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.360
The handshake protocol

06:32.360 --> 06:33.460
is very important.

06:33.780 --> 06:34.160
It is

06:34.160 --> 06:36.260
a full handshake

06:36.260 --> 06:36.920
meaning that

06:36.920 --> 06:38.040
it requires

06:38.040 --> 06:39.160
an initiator,

06:39.260 --> 06:39.720
the client,

06:39.860 --> 06:41.080
to send something first

06:41.080 --> 06:42.800
usually not authenticated

06:42.800 --> 06:44.040
because the first message

06:44.040 --> 06:44.940
cannot be authenticated

06:44.940 --> 06:48.160
if there's no prior

06:48.160 --> 06:48.700
contact.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.360
And then the server replies

06:51.360 --> 06:52.420
also with usually

06:52.420 --> 06:53.940
not authenticated message

06:53.940 --> 06:54.700
saying,

06:54.700 --> 06:56.060
here's my certificate

06:56.060 --> 06:58.980
and then the server

06:58.980 --> 06:59.560
already computes

06:59.560 --> 07:00.180
a session ID

07:00.180 --> 07:00.820
because remember

07:00.820 --> 07:02.000
the client supplies

07:02.000 --> 07:02.880
a random number

07:02.880 --> 07:03.380
a nonce

07:03.380 --> 07:04.240
in the first message

07:04.240 --> 07:04.920
client hello

07:04.920 --> 07:06.400
the server replies

07:06.400 --> 07:07.300
with a certificate

07:07.300 --> 07:08.420
and the server hello

07:08.420 --> 07:09.260
and that contains

07:09.260 --> 07:09.760
a nonce.

07:10.220 --> 07:11.700
So, given the two nonces

07:11.700 --> 07:13.700
and some other stuff

07:13.700 --> 07:14.900
they have a session ID

07:14.900 --> 07:16.860
so they can identify

07:16.860 --> 07:19.040
this particular session

07:19.040 --> 07:20.360
between this client

07:20.360 --> 07:21.040
and this server.

07:22.260 --> 07:22.400
Okay?

07:22.700 --> 07:23.560
And recall that

07:23.560 --> 07:24.400
99%

07:24.400 --> 07:25.720
more than 99%

07:25.720 --> 07:26.220
of the cases

07:26.220 --> 07:27.180
client authentication

07:27.180 --> 07:28.380
isn't done

07:28.380 --> 07:29.620
in SSL TLS.

07:29.780 --> 07:30.680
It can be done

07:30.680 --> 07:31.900
but it isn't done

07:31.900 --> 07:33.300
for reasons

07:33.300 --> 07:34.260
that I already discussed.

07:36.100 --> 07:36.340
Right?

07:37.640 --> 07:38.200
And

07:38.200 --> 07:43.000
most of the time

07:43.000 --> 07:43.440
today

07:43.440 --> 07:44.120
you will see

07:44.120 --> 07:44.780
that most

07:44.780 --> 07:47.400
key exchange

07:47.400 --> 07:47.720
right?

07:49.580 --> 07:49.860
Not

07:49.860 --> 07:50.180
right?

07:50.260 --> 07:50.700
Key exchange

07:50.700 --> 07:51.060
is done

07:51.060 --> 07:51.820
using RSA

07:51.820 --> 07:52.820
where the client

07:52.820 --> 07:53.800
picks what's called

07:53.800 --> 07:54.880
pre-master secret

07:54.880 --> 07:56.220
encrypts it

07:56.220 --> 07:57.180
using the server's

07:57.180 --> 07:57.780
public key

07:57.780 --> 07:58.800
all this is

07:58.800 --> 07:59.680
after you check

07:59.680 --> 08:00.580
the server certificate

08:00.580 --> 08:00.960
right?

08:01.300 --> 08:02.140
You don't do this

08:02.140 --> 08:02.320
right?

08:02.360 --> 08:03.280
The client abandons

08:03.280 --> 08:03.780
the protocol

08:03.780 --> 08:04.760
if there's something

08:04.760 --> 08:05.340
wrong with the

08:05.340 --> 08:06.000
server certificate.

08:07.120 --> 08:07.860
Do you remember that?

08:09.060 --> 08:09.400
Yes?

08:10.440 --> 08:11.600
So the idea

08:11.600 --> 08:12.980
in security protocols

08:12.980 --> 08:13.800
is you don't

08:13.800 --> 08:15.280
do heavy work

08:15.280 --> 08:15.940
before you do

08:15.940 --> 08:16.620
light work.

08:17.220 --> 08:18.100
So the light work

08:18.100 --> 08:19.240
means you make sure

08:19.240 --> 08:20.840
that the server name

08:20.840 --> 08:21.420
in the certificate

08:21.420 --> 08:22.700
matches the URL

08:22.700 --> 08:23.560
the domain name

08:23.560 --> 08:24.180
of the URL.

08:25.160 --> 08:25.600
Otherwise

08:25.600 --> 08:26.740
you're being phished

08:26.740 --> 08:27.800
and attacked.

08:28.080 --> 08:28.220
Okay?

08:28.340 --> 08:29.140
You're being scammed.

08:29.140 --> 08:32.880
So test the map.

08:34.240 --> 08:34.840
Of course

08:34.840 --> 08:35.880
it doesn't help you

08:35.880 --> 08:37.220
if you mistyped the name.

08:38.900 --> 08:39.780
If you went

08:39.780 --> 08:40.640
wanted to go to

08:40.640 --> 08:41.780
wellsbargo.com

08:41.780 --> 08:42.500
and you typed

08:42.500 --> 08:43.960
wellsbargo.com

08:43.960 --> 08:45.100
well guess what?

08:45.440 --> 08:46.020
If somebody

08:46.020 --> 08:46.740
if somebody

08:46.740 --> 08:47.640
has a website

08:47.640 --> 08:49.300
called wellsbargo.com

08:49.300 --> 08:50.260
and registered it

08:50.260 --> 08:51.340
and has a certificate

08:51.340 --> 08:52.380
that's where you're

08:52.380 --> 08:52.720
going to go

08:52.720 --> 08:53.660
and SSL TLS

08:53.660 --> 08:54.620
will not help you.

08:54.620 --> 08:58.420
It doesn't sound

08:58.420 --> 08:59.020
too good

08:59.020 --> 08:59.380
does it?

09:01.380 --> 09:02.120
That's called

09:02.120 --> 09:03.700
that kind of attack

09:03.700 --> 09:04.020
was called

09:04.020 --> 09:04.840
type of squatting

09:04.840 --> 09:06.160
where

09:06.160 --> 09:07.460
adversaries

09:07.460 --> 09:08.420
or sometimes

09:08.420 --> 09:09.280
not even adversaries

09:09.280 --> 09:10.160
are like

09:10.160 --> 09:11.360
porn sites

09:11.360 --> 09:12.100
or like

09:12.100 --> 09:13.600
marketing sites

09:13.600 --> 09:14.300
will set up

09:14.300 --> 09:16.640
a domain name

09:16.640 --> 09:17.980
a domain name

09:17.980 --> 09:18.740
that closely

09:18.740 --> 09:19.620
resembles a

09:19.620 --> 09:20.100
legitimate

09:20.100 --> 09:20.800
well-known

09:20.800 --> 09:21.500
domain name

09:21.500 --> 09:23.400
hoping that

09:23.400 --> 09:23.860
the users

09:23.860 --> 09:25.160
will mistype

09:25.160 --> 09:26.900
the name

09:26.900 --> 09:29.220
and they will

09:29.220 --> 09:29.820
land on their

09:29.820 --> 09:30.120
site.

09:30.700 --> 09:31.480
In the worst case

09:31.480 --> 09:31.940
you will see

09:31.940 --> 09:32.840
some questionable

09:32.840 --> 09:33.340
content

09:33.340 --> 09:34.520
or you know

09:34.520 --> 09:35.720
a walking tub

09:35.720 --> 09:36.620
will be advertised

09:36.620 --> 09:36.960
to you

09:36.960 --> 09:37.620
by Akron.

09:38.600 --> 09:39.760
In the worst case

09:39.760 --> 09:40.640
you'll be fished.

09:42.700 --> 09:43.000
Okay?

09:43.080 --> 09:43.600
Meaning that

09:43.600 --> 09:44.440
they will present

09:44.440 --> 09:44.900
to you something

09:44.900 --> 09:45.540
that looks like

09:45.540 --> 09:46.480
a wellsbargo page

09:46.480 --> 09:47.140
and you'll

09:47.140 --> 09:47.680
blindly

09:47.680 --> 09:49.460
most people

09:49.460 --> 09:49.980
blindly

09:49.980 --> 09:50.640
type their

09:50.640 --> 09:51.120
username

09:51.120 --> 09:51.620
and password

09:51.620 --> 09:52.560
and that's it.

09:53.280 --> 09:53.740
Bye-bye.

09:55.780 --> 09:56.120
And so

09:56.120 --> 09:56.820
SSLTLS

09:56.820 --> 09:57.400
won't help you

09:57.400 --> 09:57.740
with this

09:57.740 --> 09:58.920
but if you

09:58.920 --> 10:00.100
click

10:00.100 --> 10:00.800
let's say

10:00.800 --> 10:01.440
on a bookmark

10:01.440 --> 10:02.060
that you put

10:02.060 --> 10:02.940
a long time ago

10:02.940 --> 10:03.280
that says

10:03.280 --> 10:04.380
wellsbargo.com

10:04.380 --> 10:06.600
SSLTLS

10:06.600 --> 10:07.200
will help you

10:07.200 --> 10:08.500
because there's

10:08.500 --> 10:09.080
no typos

10:09.080 --> 10:09.440
right?

10:15.540 --> 10:16.100
Right.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.280
So most

10:17.280 --> 10:17.660
common

10:17.660 --> 10:18.640
in

10:18.640 --> 10:19.720
TLS

10:19.720 --> 10:20.160
before

10:20.160 --> 10:21.400
version 1.3

10:21.400 --> 10:21.740
remember

10:21.740 --> 10:22.260
I told you

10:22.260 --> 10:22.680
there's like

10:22.680 --> 10:23.120
two real

10:23.120 --> 10:23.500
versions

10:23.500 --> 10:23.940
out there

10:23.940 --> 10:24.300
today

10:24.300 --> 10:25.060
there's

10:25.060 --> 10:25.280
really

10:25.280 --> 10:26.300
TLS 1.2

10:26.300 --> 10:27.060
and 1.3

10:27.060 --> 10:27.620
they probably

10:27.620 --> 10:28.000
used

10:28.000 --> 10:29.560
the most

10:29.560 --> 10:30.000
there are

10:30.000 --> 10:31.100
lower versions

10:31.100 --> 10:31.820
older versions

10:31.820 --> 10:32.500
still in use

10:32.500 --> 10:33.040
but they're

10:33.040 --> 10:33.880
being deprecated

10:33.880 --> 10:34.960
so a lot

10:34.960 --> 10:35.920
of web

10:35.920 --> 10:36.380
servers

10:36.380 --> 10:38.220
will simply

10:38.220 --> 10:38.960
not accept

10:38.960 --> 10:39.700
a conversation

10:39.700 --> 10:40.620
and TLS

10:40.620 --> 10:40.980
session

10:40.980 --> 10:41.660
with a client

10:41.660 --> 10:42.400
that does

10:42.400 --> 10:42.960
not support

10:42.960 --> 10:43.340
at least

10:43.340 --> 10:44.120
1.2

10:44.120 --> 10:45.040
TLS

10:45.040 --> 10:46.460
now 1.2

10:46.460 --> 10:47.120
and 1.3

10:47.120 --> 10:47.500
differ

10:47.500 --> 10:48.000
I already

10:48.000 --> 10:48.920
alluded to

10:48.920 --> 10:49.220
that

10:49.220 --> 10:50.340
but my

10:50.340 --> 10:50.900
discussion

10:50.900 --> 10:52.280
last time

10:52.280 --> 10:53.120
was focused

10:53.120 --> 10:53.960
on 1.2

10:53.960 --> 10:58.840
so in

10:58.840 --> 10:59.680
1.3

10:59.680 --> 11:01.320
unlike here

11:01.320 --> 11:02.480
you can

11:02.480 --> 11:02.980
no longer

11:02.980 --> 11:03.880
use RSA

11:03.880 --> 11:04.440
to encrypt

11:04.440 --> 11:06.920
okay

11:06.920 --> 11:08.360
in 1.3

11:08.360 --> 11:09.220
you have to

11:09.220 --> 11:09.920
basically use

11:09.920 --> 11:10.480
signatures

11:10.480 --> 11:11.500
and use

11:11.500 --> 11:12.160
Diffie-Hellman

11:12.160 --> 11:12.600
or something

11:12.600 --> 11:13.180
similar to

11:13.180 --> 11:13.700
Diffie-Hellman

11:13.700 --> 11:14.600
for key exchange

11:14.600 --> 11:15.240
you cannot use

11:15.240 --> 11:15.800
RSA

11:15.800 --> 11:16.620
for key exchange

11:16.620 --> 11:21.640
right

11:21.640 --> 11:22.500
we looked at

11:22.500 --> 11:23.020
how key is

11:23.020 --> 11:23.540
derived

11:23.540 --> 11:23.940
right

11:23.940 --> 11:24.540
because remember

11:24.540 --> 11:24.880
there's

11:24.880 --> 11:25.920
pre-master secret

11:25.920 --> 11:26.460
then there's

11:26.460 --> 11:26.780
like a

11:26.780 --> 11:27.500
master secret

11:27.500 --> 11:28.100
well

11:28.100 --> 11:29.420
in TLS 1.3

11:29.420 --> 11:30.040
I believe

11:30.040 --> 11:30.540
there's no

11:30.540 --> 11:31.780
pre-master secret

11:31.780 --> 11:32.620
because actually

11:32.620 --> 11:33.540
both sides

11:33.540 --> 11:34.180
contribute to

11:34.180 --> 11:34.580
the key

11:34.580 --> 11:35.520
and compute

11:35.520 --> 11:35.900
what's called

11:35.900 --> 11:36.620
the master secret

11:36.620 --> 11:37.600
because Diffie-Hellman

11:37.600 --> 11:38.280
is symmetric

11:38.280 --> 11:39.360
symmetric

11:39.360 --> 11:40.200
meaning both sides

11:40.200 --> 11:41.000
contribute equally

11:41.000 --> 11:42.280
and then

11:42.280 --> 11:43.160
using the master

11:43.160 --> 11:43.580
secret

11:43.580 --> 11:44.220
we derive

11:44.220 --> 11:44.700
using

11:44.700 --> 11:45.960
something called

11:45.960 --> 11:46.900
the k-derivation

11:46.900 --> 11:47.360
function

11:47.360 --> 11:48.640
a set of

11:48.640 --> 11:49.160
other keys

11:49.160 --> 11:49.400
right

11:49.400 --> 11:50.000
that we actually

11:50.000 --> 11:50.620
use for

11:50.620 --> 11:51.020
encryption

11:51.020 --> 11:51.660
and authentication

11:51.660 --> 11:53.100
during the

11:53.100 --> 11:54.220
data transfer

11:54.220 --> 11:59.260
okay

11:59.260 --> 11:59.980
we looked at

11:59.980 --> 12:00.420
this

12:00.420 --> 12:00.920
this

12:00.920 --> 12:01.240
this

12:01.240 --> 12:02.380
and then

12:02.380 --> 12:02.600
there was

12:02.600 --> 12:03.000
a summary

12:03.000 --> 12:03.320
right

12:03.320 --> 12:05.940
we stopped

12:05.940 --> 12:06.440
around here

12:06.440 --> 12:06.900
no

12:06.900 --> 12:09.280
this is a

12:09.280 --> 12:09.620
summary

12:09.620 --> 12:10.060
of

12:10.060 --> 12:11.960
a

12:11.960 --> 12:12.440
handshake

12:12.440 --> 12:13.520
client

12:13.520 --> 12:13.900
below

12:13.900 --> 12:14.600
followed by

12:14.600 --> 12:15.740
three messages

12:15.740 --> 12:16.780
essentially put

12:16.780 --> 12:17.220
together

12:17.220 --> 12:17.900
server hello

12:17.900 --> 12:18.180
server

12:18.180 --> 12:18.800
certificate

12:18.800 --> 12:19.240
change

12:19.240 --> 12:19.700
server hello

12:19.700 --> 12:20.040
down

12:20.040 --> 12:20.840
then

12:20.840 --> 12:22.220
client returns

12:22.220 --> 12:22.600
to server

12:22.600 --> 12:22.880
saying

12:22.880 --> 12:23.360
okay

12:23.360 --> 12:24.100
this is client

12:24.100 --> 12:24.700
key exchange

12:24.700 --> 12:25.200
message

12:25.200 --> 12:25.660
right

12:25.660 --> 12:26.420
so now

12:26.420 --> 12:27.020
that message

12:27.020 --> 12:27.780
can be secured

12:27.780 --> 12:28.220
already

12:28.220 --> 12:29.180
client finished

12:29.180 --> 12:29.640
by the way

12:29.640 --> 12:30.160
contains

12:30.160 --> 12:30.800
in mac

12:30.800 --> 12:31.960
of all

12:31.960 --> 12:33.140
of everything

12:33.140 --> 12:34.300
exchanged so far

12:34.300 --> 12:35.400
computed

12:35.400 --> 12:36.260
with a key

12:36.260 --> 12:36.940
that they just

12:36.940 --> 12:37.400
agree on

12:37.400 --> 12:39.340
master secret

12:39.340 --> 12:39.660
key

12:39.660 --> 12:40.880
and the last

12:40.880 --> 12:41.480
message in the

12:41.480 --> 12:41.840
exchange

12:41.840 --> 12:42.280
is server

12:42.280 --> 12:43.080
goes to client

12:43.080 --> 12:44.380
says confirming

12:44.380 --> 12:45.220
that we selected

12:45.220 --> 12:45.560
this

12:45.560 --> 12:46.400
I mean this

12:46.400 --> 12:47.380
wording is confusing

12:47.380 --> 12:47.720
change

12:47.720 --> 12:48.380
they're not changing

12:48.380 --> 12:48.920
any cyphers

12:48.920 --> 12:49.140
today

12:49.140 --> 12:50.180
right

12:50.180 --> 12:50.940
they already agreed

12:50.940 --> 12:51.600
on what cyphers

12:51.600 --> 12:51.980
they use

12:51.980 --> 12:53.380
important one

12:53.380 --> 12:53.760
is server

12:53.760 --> 12:54.160
finished

12:54.160 --> 12:54.920
that can also

12:54.920 --> 12:55.300
contain

12:55.300 --> 12:55.800
a mac

12:55.800 --> 12:58.140
of all the

12:58.140 --> 12:58.820
messages exchanged

12:58.820 --> 12:59.740
from the

12:59.740 --> 13:00.020
service

13:00.020 --> 13:00.440
perspective

13:00.440 --> 13:02.460
so if the

13:02.460 --> 13:03.080
survey of the

13:03.080 --> 13:03.680
client have

13:03.680 --> 13:04.300
the same view

13:04.300 --> 13:04.760
of messages

13:04.760 --> 13:05.520
sent and received

13:05.520 --> 13:06.360
that means

13:06.360 --> 13:07.160
no one

13:07.160 --> 13:08.400
has interfered

13:08.400 --> 13:08.640
with the

13:08.640 --> 13:08.980
protocol

13:08.980 --> 13:11.340
not a single

13:11.340 --> 13:11.740
bit has

13:11.740 --> 13:12.340
changed

13:12.340 --> 13:13.280
then they're

13:13.280 --> 13:13.940
sure that

13:13.940 --> 13:14.380
they're talking

13:14.380 --> 13:14.960
to each other

13:14.960 --> 13:16.380
and that

13:16.380 --> 13:17.060
completes the

13:17.060 --> 13:17.400
handshake

13:17.400 --> 13:23.060
we talked

13:23.060 --> 13:23.700
about this

13:23.700 --> 13:32.380
talking about

13:32.380 --> 13:32.820
this

13:32.820 --> 13:33.400
there's some

13:33.400 --> 13:33.820
options

13:33.820 --> 13:36.700
yes

13:36.700 --> 13:37.300
so the other

13:37.300 --> 13:37.800
thing you can

13:37.800 --> 13:38.140
do

13:38.140 --> 13:39.880
is if

13:39.880 --> 13:41.300
client and

13:41.300 --> 13:41.880
server have

13:41.880 --> 13:42.500
previously

13:42.500 --> 13:43.700
established

13:43.700 --> 13:45.880
SSL-TLS

13:45.880 --> 13:46.300
connection

13:46.300 --> 13:47.520
there is already

13:47.520 --> 13:48.280
a session ID

13:48.280 --> 13:48.800
remember there

13:48.800 --> 13:49.620
was a session ID

13:49.620 --> 13:50.000
derived

13:50.000 --> 13:50.800
that identified

13:50.800 --> 13:52.080
the SSL-TLS

13:52.080 --> 13:52.600
connection

13:52.600 --> 13:54.740
the client

13:54.740 --> 13:55.880
can resume

13:55.880 --> 13:56.820
the connection

13:56.820 --> 13:58.800
yeah

13:58.800 --> 13:59.600
resume

13:59.600 --> 14:00.120
means

14:00.120 --> 14:01.200
hey

14:01.200 --> 14:01.900
I'm still

14:01.900 --> 14:02.220
here

14:02.220 --> 14:03.500
I'm still

14:03.500 --> 14:03.800
here

14:03.800 --> 14:05.780
there's two

14:05.780 --> 14:06.140
purposes

14:06.140 --> 14:06.500
for that

14:06.500 --> 14:07.140
this one's

14:07.140 --> 14:07.600
kind of like

14:07.600 --> 14:08.820
saying I'm

14:08.820 --> 14:09.080
around

14:09.080 --> 14:09.480
don't

14:09.480 --> 14:09.700
don't

14:09.700 --> 14:09.940
don't

14:09.940 --> 14:10.200
flush

14:10.200 --> 14:10.660
the state

14:10.660 --> 14:10.900
right

14:10.900 --> 14:11.260
I'm still

14:11.260 --> 14:11.580
here

14:11.580 --> 14:13.440
and the

14:13.440 --> 14:13.940
other one

14:13.940 --> 14:14.400
is

14:14.400 --> 14:14.920
the other

14:14.920 --> 14:15.360
purpose

14:15.360 --> 14:15.920
is

14:15.920 --> 14:16.460
oh

14:16.460 --> 14:17.040
let's

14:17.040 --> 14:17.280
change

14:17.280 --> 14:17.540
keys

14:17.540 --> 14:17.840
let's

14:17.840 --> 14:18.280
refresh

14:18.280 --> 14:18.620
key

14:18.620 --> 14:20.380
okay

14:20.380 --> 14:21.040
so

14:21.040 --> 14:22.400
if you

14:22.400 --> 14:22.940
have

14:22.940 --> 14:23.680
what's called

14:23.680 --> 14:24.500
session resumption

14:24.500 --> 14:24.760
right

14:24.760 --> 14:25.340
you can

14:25.340 --> 14:26.060
essentially

14:26.060 --> 14:27.820
maintain the

14:27.820 --> 14:28.220
same

14:28.220 --> 14:29.260
not have to

14:29.260 --> 14:29.720
redo the

14:29.720 --> 14:30.120
handshake

14:30.120 --> 14:30.440
right

14:30.440 --> 14:30.940
you can

14:30.940 --> 14:31.600
maintain the

14:31.600 --> 14:31.860
same

14:31.860 --> 14:32.620
master secret

14:32.620 --> 14:33.280
but the

14:33.280 --> 14:33.860
nonsense can

14:33.860 --> 14:34.260
change

14:34.260 --> 14:36.320
remember

14:36.320 --> 14:36.640
nonsense

14:36.640 --> 14:36.920
these

14:36.920 --> 14:37.440
randoms

14:37.440 --> 14:37.860
they can

14:37.860 --> 14:38.160
change

14:38.160 --> 14:39.060
and so

14:39.060 --> 14:40.020
the actual

14:40.020 --> 14:41.500
encryption keys

14:41.500 --> 14:42.040
and authentication

14:42.040 --> 14:43.000
keys will change

14:43.000 --> 14:43.480
as a result

14:43.480 --> 14:45.000
you can

14:45.000 --> 14:45.420
theoretically

14:45.420 --> 14:46.100
also change

14:46.100 --> 14:46.900
the cipher suite

14:46.900 --> 14:48.740
at that point

14:48.740 --> 14:49.760
most of the time

14:49.760 --> 14:50.400
that doesn't happen

14:50.400 --> 14:50.800
but you can

14:50.800 --> 14:50.980
change

14:50.980 --> 14:51.420
say ah

14:51.420 --> 14:52.120
we'll be using

14:52.120 --> 14:52.820
I don't know

14:52.820 --> 14:53.380
RSA

14:53.380 --> 14:54.720
with

14:54.720 --> 14:56.500
AES

14:56.500 --> 14:57.040
let's switch

14:57.040 --> 14:57.440
to something

14:57.440 --> 14:57.680
else

14:57.680 --> 14:58.360
you could do

14:58.360 --> 14:58.580
that

14:58.580 --> 14:59.440
if the

14:59.440 --> 15:00.200
policy allows

15:00.200 --> 15:00.680
if both

15:00.680 --> 15:01.040
sides

15:01.040 --> 15:01.320
agree

15:01.320 --> 15:01.620
you can

15:01.620 --> 15:01.740
do

15:01.740 --> 15:06.280
never mind

15:06.280 --> 15:06.720
this

15:06.720 --> 15:08.760
so

15:08.760 --> 15:09.660
the main

15:09.660 --> 15:11.160
I'm not going

15:11.160 --> 15:11.600
to go in

15:11.600 --> 15:12.300
such detail

15:12.300 --> 15:13.400
over 1.3

15:13.400 --> 15:14.840
it is actually

15:14.840 --> 15:15.600
in some ways

15:15.600 --> 15:16.180
a simpler

15:16.180 --> 15:16.720
protocol

15:16.720 --> 15:19.620
let's

15:19.620 --> 15:20.300
zoom

15:20.300 --> 15:21.020
on this

15:21.020 --> 15:25.700
this is a

15:25.700 --> 15:26.080
handshake

15:26.080 --> 15:27.060
so what we've

15:27.060 --> 15:27.800
seen is this

15:27.800 --> 15:28.600
right

15:28.600 --> 15:29.420
the first

15:29.420 --> 15:30.380
four messages

15:30.380 --> 15:31.320
are the handshake

15:31.320 --> 15:31.980
and then you get

15:31.980 --> 15:32.760
the HTTP

15:32.760 --> 15:33.100
get

15:33.100 --> 15:33.520
HTTP

15:33.520 --> 15:34.000
right

15:34.000 --> 15:35.580
because this

15:35.580 --> 15:35.960
is what you

15:35.960 --> 15:36.360
really want

15:36.360 --> 15:36.620
right

15:36.620 --> 15:36.980
you want

15:36.980 --> 15:38.000
to fetch

15:38.000 --> 15:38.440
a URL

15:38.440 --> 15:40.780
so this

15:40.780 --> 15:41.900
and this

15:41.900 --> 15:42.220
gives you

15:42.220 --> 15:42.440
like

15:42.440 --> 15:43.040
this timeline

15:43.040 --> 15:43.420
gives you

15:43.420 --> 15:43.840
approximate

15:43.840 --> 15:44.160
like

15:44.160 --> 15:44.960
for comparison

15:44.960 --> 15:45.680
an average

15:45.680 --> 15:46.140
timeline

15:46.140 --> 15:47.180
for how long

15:47.180 --> 15:47.520
it takes

15:47.520 --> 15:48.200
so if you look

15:48.200 --> 15:48.380
at

15:48.380 --> 15:49.420
it starts

15:49.420 --> 15:49.980
with 0

15:49.980 --> 15:50.400
and

15:50.400 --> 15:51.800
it's 200

15:51.800 --> 15:52.440
milliseconds

15:52.440 --> 15:53.240
until you get

15:53.240 --> 15:53.540
here

15:53.540 --> 15:56.060
okay

15:56.060 --> 15:56.520
that's two

15:56.520 --> 15:57.100
round trips

15:57.100 --> 15:59.540
and that's

15:59.540 --> 16:00.120
pure overhead

16:00.120 --> 16:00.700
and so now

16:00.700 --> 16:01.420
it's pure overhead

16:01.420 --> 16:03.240
as far as

16:03.240 --> 16:03.800
the user

16:03.800 --> 16:04.820
is concerned

16:04.820 --> 16:06.280
and then the

16:06.280 --> 16:06.700
real useful

16:06.700 --> 16:07.160
stuff is

16:07.160 --> 16:07.880
get and put

16:07.880 --> 16:08.160
right

16:08.160 --> 16:08.760
here

16:08.760 --> 16:10.460
now with

16:10.460 --> 16:13.760
version 1.3

16:13.760 --> 16:14.820
there's just

16:14.820 --> 16:16.800
one round trip

16:16.800 --> 16:19.740
and then

16:19.740 --> 16:20.660
two packets

16:20.660 --> 16:21.540
plan

16:21.540 --> 16:22.100
hello

16:22.100 --> 16:23.720
key share

16:23.720 --> 16:24.460
and then

16:24.460 --> 16:24.740
server

16:24.740 --> 16:25.020
hello

16:25.020 --> 16:25.420
key share

16:25.420 --> 16:25.900
certificate

16:25.900 --> 16:26.340
certificate

16:26.340 --> 16:26.660
verify

16:26.660 --> 16:27.240
blah blah blah

16:27.240 --> 16:27.400
blah blah

16:27.400 --> 16:28.180
okay

16:28.180 --> 16:28.660
we're not going

16:28.660 --> 16:28.840
to go

16:28.840 --> 16:30.180
through the exact

16:30.180 --> 16:30.540
format

16:30.540 --> 16:31.100
but

16:31.100 --> 16:31.920
essentially

16:31.920 --> 16:32.400
the time

16:32.400 --> 16:32.920
is cut in

16:32.920 --> 16:33.280
half

16:33.280 --> 16:34.480
with pretty

16:34.480 --> 16:34.780
much

16:34.780 --> 16:35.280
the same

16:35.280 --> 16:35.800
result

16:35.800 --> 16:36.380
that the

16:36.380 --> 16:36.900
two parties

16:36.900 --> 16:37.800
there's still

16:37.800 --> 16:38.360
a handshake

16:38.360 --> 16:38.780
it's just

16:38.780 --> 16:39.760
a two message

16:39.760 --> 16:40.240
handshake

16:40.240 --> 16:40.780
not a four

16:40.780 --> 16:41.100
message

16:41.100 --> 16:41.560
handshake

16:41.560 --> 16:43.800
and it's

16:43.800 --> 16:44.420
faster

16:44.420 --> 16:44.880
obviously

16:44.880 --> 16:45.140
right

16:45.140 --> 16:45.700
so 100

16:45.700 --> 16:46.180
milliseconds

16:46.180 --> 16:46.920
you might

16:46.920 --> 16:47.780
not really

16:47.780 --> 16:48.120
care

16:48.120 --> 16:49.800
but over

16:49.800 --> 16:50.200
time

16:50.200 --> 16:51.060
this adds up

16:51.060 --> 16:51.260
right

16:51.260 --> 16:51.660
for many

16:51.660 --> 16:52.120
users

16:52.120 --> 16:52.800
over time

16:52.800 --> 16:53.080
right

16:53.080 --> 16:54.360
a lot of

16:54.360 --> 16:54.760
traffic

16:54.760 --> 16:55.620
a lot of

16:55.620 --> 16:55.980
delays

16:55.980 --> 16:57.340
so cutting

16:57.340 --> 16:57.820
things in

16:57.820 --> 16:58.220
half is

16:58.220 --> 16:58.520
better

16:58.520 --> 17:00.060
you had a

17:00.060 --> 17:00.300
question

17:00.300 --> 17:01.420
what's the

17:01.420 --> 17:01.960
improvement

17:01.960 --> 17:02.340
that

17:02.340 --> 17:03.020
okay

17:03.020 --> 17:04.180
many

17:04.180 --> 17:04.880
there are

17:04.880 --> 17:05.180
a number

17:05.180 --> 17:05.820
of improvements

17:05.820 --> 17:07.020
one of the

17:07.020 --> 17:07.400
things is

17:07.400 --> 17:08.120
simplification

17:08.120 --> 17:08.940
so

17:08.940 --> 17:10.220
TLS

17:10.220 --> 17:11.220
1.2

17:11.220 --> 17:11.760
and B4

17:11.760 --> 17:13.080
they have

17:13.080 --> 17:13.740
way too

17:13.740 --> 17:13.940
many

17:13.940 --> 17:14.640
cipher suites

17:14.640 --> 17:15.920
some of

17:15.920 --> 17:16.160
them

17:16.160 --> 17:17.320
got deprecated

17:17.320 --> 17:17.900
because they

17:17.900 --> 17:18.540
were like

17:18.540 --> 17:19.720
RC4

17:19.720 --> 17:20.600
is a

17:20.600 --> 17:20.940
cipher

17:20.940 --> 17:22.460
MD5

17:22.460 --> 17:22.800
a hash

17:22.800 --> 17:23.240
function

17:23.240 --> 17:24.820
they are

17:24.820 --> 17:25.140
broken

17:25.140 --> 17:26.100
or at least

17:26.100 --> 17:26.540
they are

17:26.540 --> 17:26.940
no longer

17:26.940 --> 17:27.340
secure

17:27.340 --> 17:28.440
DDS

17:28.440 --> 17:29.420
triple

17:29.420 --> 17:29.860
DES

17:29.860 --> 17:31.360
no longer

17:31.360 --> 17:31.760
considered

17:31.760 --> 17:32.240
secure

17:32.240 --> 17:32.640
or too

17:32.640 --> 17:33.120
expensive

17:33.120 --> 17:33.680
I forget

17:33.680 --> 17:33.980
exactly

17:33.980 --> 17:34.180
yeah

17:34.180 --> 17:34.460
I think

17:34.460 --> 17:34.600
it's

17:34.600 --> 17:34.900
no longer

17:34.900 --> 17:35.200
considered

17:35.200 --> 17:35.500
secure

17:35.500 --> 17:36.160
so

17:36.160 --> 17:37.980
most of

17:37.980 --> 17:38.200
the

17:38.200 --> 17:38.860
time

17:38.860 --> 17:39.720
today

17:39.720 --> 17:41.120
you

17:41.120 --> 17:41.280
will

17:41.280 --> 17:41.520
see

17:41.520 --> 17:42.100
AES

17:42.100 --> 17:43.520
as

17:43.520 --> 17:43.780
the

17:43.780 --> 17:44.840
encryption

17:44.840 --> 17:45.180
as

17:45.180 --> 17:45.300
the

17:45.300 --> 17:45.500
bulk

17:45.500 --> 17:45.780
encryption

17:45.780 --> 17:46.140
you

17:46.140 --> 17:46.220
will

17:46.220 --> 17:46.420
see

17:46.420 --> 17:47.900
SHA-256

17:47.900 --> 17:48.080
you

17:48.080 --> 17:48.280
will

17:48.280 --> 17:48.500
not

17:48.500 --> 17:48.660
see

17:48.660 --> 17:49.640
SHA-128

17:49.640 --> 17:50.220
anymore

17:50.220 --> 17:50.920
so

17:50.920 --> 17:52.520
rather than

17:52.520 --> 17:53.080
hundreds

17:53.080 --> 17:53.540
of

17:53.540 --> 17:54.600
cipher suites

17:54.600 --> 17:55.040
I think

17:55.040 --> 17:55.520
the

17:55.520 --> 17:56.720
main ones

17:56.720 --> 17:57.100
are like

17:57.100 --> 17:58.040
five or six

17:58.040 --> 17:58.320
today

17:58.320 --> 18:00.420
and

18:00.420 --> 18:00.980
they're not

18:00.980 --> 18:01.720
using RSA

18:01.720 --> 18:02.220
anymore

18:02.220 --> 18:02.700
so

18:02.700 --> 18:03.900
also

18:03.900 --> 18:04.440
the names

18:04.440 --> 18:04.700
of the

18:04.700 --> 18:05.180
cipher suites

18:05.180 --> 18:05.460
changed

18:05.460 --> 18:05.620
like

18:05.620 --> 18:05.860
I remember

18:05.860 --> 18:06.260
I was showing

18:06.260 --> 18:06.580
like

18:06.580 --> 18:07.640
TLS

18:07.640 --> 18:08.680
RSA

18:08.680 --> 18:09.280
with

18:09.280 --> 18:09.920
blah blah blah

18:09.920 --> 18:10.180
blah blah

18:10.180 --> 18:11.020
and

18:11.020 --> 18:11.900
the first

18:11.900 --> 18:12.120
thing

18:12.120 --> 18:12.340
that

18:12.340 --> 18:12.940
this

18:12.940 --> 18:13.780
string

18:13.780 --> 18:13.980
would

18:13.980 --> 18:14.420
tell you

18:14.420 --> 18:14.740
is

18:14.740 --> 18:15.460
how

18:15.460 --> 18:15.740
are we

18:15.740 --> 18:16.120
exchanging

18:16.120 --> 18:16.520
keys

18:16.520 --> 18:17.120
which is

18:17.120 --> 18:17.420
how

18:17.420 --> 18:18.000
RSA

18:18.000 --> 18:18.300
when you

18:18.300 --> 18:18.580
client

18:18.580 --> 18:19.000
increase

18:19.000 --> 18:19.680
a random

18:19.680 --> 18:19.940
number

18:19.940 --> 18:20.360
for the

18:20.360 --> 18:21.280
server

18:21.280 --> 18:21.900
and the

18:21.900 --> 18:22.100
second

18:22.100 --> 18:22.400
one

18:22.400 --> 18:22.860
was

18:22.860 --> 18:25.560
how

18:25.560 --> 18:25.760
does

18:25.760 --> 18:26.000
server

18:26.000 --> 18:26.460
authenticate

18:26.460 --> 18:28.100
also

18:28.100 --> 18:28.540
RSA

18:28.540 --> 18:29.180
because

18:29.180 --> 18:29.380
he

18:29.380 --> 18:29.900
decrypts

18:29.900 --> 18:30.440
right

18:30.440 --> 18:30.960
and

18:30.960 --> 18:31.440
something

18:31.440 --> 18:31.840
that the

18:31.840 --> 18:32.100
client

18:32.100 --> 18:32.340
sent

18:32.340 --> 18:32.560
to him

18:32.560 --> 18:32.680
and

18:32.680 --> 18:32.820
can

18:32.820 --> 18:33.460
implicitly

18:33.460 --> 18:33.700
authenticate

18:33.700 --> 18:34.300
so

18:34.300 --> 18:34.620
that's

18:34.620 --> 18:34.900
gone

18:34.900 --> 18:36.540
instead

18:36.540 --> 18:36.720
of

18:36.720 --> 18:36.920
that

18:36.920 --> 18:37.140
they

18:37.140 --> 18:37.280
no

18:37.280 --> 18:37.480
longer

18:37.480 --> 18:37.740
say

18:37.740 --> 18:37.980
how

18:37.980 --> 18:38.100
you

18:38.100 --> 18:38.420
exchange

18:38.420 --> 18:38.540
the

18:38.540 --> 18:38.680
keys

18:38.680 --> 18:38.980
everything

18:38.980 --> 18:39.220
is

18:39.220 --> 18:39.380
done

18:39.380 --> 18:39.800
essentially

18:39.800 --> 18:40.040
by

18:40.040 --> 18:40.160
a

18:40.160 --> 18:40.400
DPA

18:40.400 --> 18:40.620
element

18:40.620 --> 18:42.160
or

18:42.160 --> 18:42.460
some

18:42.460 --> 18:42.960
version

18:42.960 --> 18:43.120
of

18:43.120 --> 18:43.360
DPA

18:43.360 --> 18:43.560
element

18:43.560 --> 18:43.820
which

18:43.820 --> 18:44.020
is

18:44.020 --> 18:44.500
either

18:44.500 --> 18:44.920
elliptic

18:44.920 --> 18:45.240
curve

18:45.240 --> 18:45.640
or

18:45.640 --> 18:46.480
normal

18:46.480 --> 18:49.240
and

18:49.240 --> 18:51.200
the

18:51.200 --> 18:52.160
signatures

18:52.160 --> 18:52.820
are now

18:52.820 --> 18:53.300
required

18:53.300 --> 18:53.520
so

18:53.520 --> 18:53.740
there's

18:53.740 --> 18:53.880
no

18:53.880 --> 18:54.080
more

18:54.080 --> 18:54.580
implicit

18:54.580 --> 18:55.140
authentication

18:55.140 --> 18:57.560
so

18:57.560 --> 18:57.880
now

18:57.880 --> 18:58.280
both

18:58.280 --> 18:59.400
you

18:59.400 --> 18:59.600
know

18:59.600 --> 19:00.080
both

19:00.080 --> 19:00.520
clients

19:00.520 --> 19:00.660
and

19:00.660 --> 19:00.820
the

19:00.820 --> 19:01.100
server

19:01.100 --> 19:01.460
have

19:01.460 --> 19:01.620
to

19:01.620 --> 19:01.880
stop

19:01.880 --> 19:02.040
well

19:02.040 --> 19:02.240
the

19:02.240 --> 19:02.480
server

19:02.480 --> 19:02.680
has

19:02.680 --> 19:02.840
to

19:02.840 --> 19:03.100
stop

19:03.100 --> 19:03.500
basically

19:03.500 --> 19:04.480
and

19:04.480 --> 19:04.600
the

19:04.600 --> 19:04.920
client

19:04.920 --> 19:05.200
can

19:05.200 --> 19:05.600
sign

19:05.600 --> 19:05.860
with

19:05.860 --> 19:06.040
the

19:06.040 --> 19:07.760
ephemeral

19:07.760 --> 19:08.060
key

19:08.060 --> 19:08.180
they

19:08.180 --> 19:08.460
just

19:08.460 --> 19:08.840
generated

19:08.840 --> 19:09.940
okay

19:09.940 --> 19:11.140
so

19:11.140 --> 19:11.340
it's

19:11.340 --> 19:11.480
a

19:11.480 --> 19:12.080
strictly

19:12.080 --> 19:13.000
stronger

19:13.000 --> 19:14.420

19:14.420 --> 19:14.920
strictly

19:14.920 --> 19:15.320

19:15.320 --> 19:15.760
higher

19:15.760 --> 19:16.400

19:16.400 --> 19:17.380

19:17.380 --> 19:17.660

19:17.660 --> 19:17.820
the

19:17.820 --> 19:18.200

19:18.200 --> 19:19.300
so

19:19.300 --> 19:19.640
that

19:19.640 --> 19:19.860
higher

19:19.860 --> 19:20.300
security

19:20.300 --> 19:20.900
enables

19:20.900 --> 19:21.260

19:22.100 --> 19:23.600
no

19:23.600 --> 19:23.880
it's

19:23.880 --> 19:24.100

19:24.900 --> 19:25.220

19:26.920 --> 19:27.260
no

19:27.260 --> 19:27.480
it's

19:29.620 --> 19:29.880
off

19:29.880 --> 19:30.040
some

19:33.800 --> 19:34.680
allows us

19:34.680 --> 19:34.980
to do

19:34.980 --> 19:35.280
this

19:35.280 --> 19:36.460
because

19:36.460 --> 19:36.840
what the

19:36.840 --> 19:37.180
client

19:37.180 --> 19:38.120
can do

19:38.120 --> 19:38.520
now

19:38.520 --> 19:38.820
you see

19:38.820 --> 19:39.300
the client

19:39.300 --> 19:39.720
hello

19:39.720 --> 19:40.380
is still

19:40.380 --> 19:41.260
in the

19:41.260 --> 19:41.480
form

19:41.480 --> 19:42.380
the client

19:42.380 --> 19:42.740
says

19:42.740 --> 19:43.420
I don't know

19:43.420 --> 19:43.880
anything about

19:43.880 --> 19:44.360
this server

19:44.360 --> 19:44.640
right

19:44.640 --> 19:45.960
I just

19:45.960 --> 19:46.240
know the

19:46.240 --> 19:46.580
URL

19:46.580 --> 19:48.280
so what I want

19:48.280 --> 19:48.840
is I want a

19:48.840 --> 19:49.320
certificate

19:49.320 --> 19:51.160
that says

19:51.160 --> 19:52.020
that this

19:52.020 --> 19:53.080
URL is inside

19:53.080 --> 19:53.620
the certificate

19:53.620 --> 19:54.980
and it's signed

19:54.980 --> 19:55.420
by somebody

19:55.420 --> 19:55.980
I trust

19:55.980 --> 19:56.960
right

19:56.960 --> 19:58.580
so

19:58.580 --> 19:59.720
it's like

19:59.720 --> 20:00.380
essentially

20:00.380 --> 20:01.680
you come

20:01.680 --> 20:01.880
to

20:01.880 --> 20:02.620
I'm a

20:02.620 --> 20:03.180
I'm a

20:03.180 --> 20:04.440
hiring manager

20:04.440 --> 20:05.180
at a company

20:05.180 --> 20:05.920
you come to me

20:05.920 --> 20:06.380
and you say

20:06.380 --> 20:07.000
I have a UCI

20:07.000 --> 20:07.380
degree

20:07.380 --> 20:09.420
I may not have

20:09.420 --> 20:10.380
ever heard of UCI

20:10.380 --> 20:11.840
okay

20:11.840 --> 20:12.900
and I've never met

20:12.900 --> 20:13.180
you

20:13.180 --> 20:15.200
but if you give me

20:15.200 --> 20:15.940
a signed

20:15.940 --> 20:16.680
diploma

20:16.680 --> 20:19.020
signed by UCI

20:19.020 --> 20:19.520
register

20:19.520 --> 20:21.280
and then I look up

20:21.280 --> 20:22.120
UCI register

20:22.120 --> 20:23.200
and I see that

20:23.200 --> 20:24.160
they are certified

20:24.160 --> 20:24.960
by University of

20:24.960 --> 20:25.500
California

20:25.500 --> 20:26.960
Central Authority

20:26.960 --> 20:28.260
and that one

20:28.260 --> 20:28.820
is certified

20:28.820 --> 20:29.800
by a California

20:29.800 --> 20:30.800
Department of Education

20:30.800 --> 20:31.740
well

20:31.740 --> 20:32.920
I trust

20:32.920 --> 20:33.800
the Department of Education

20:33.800 --> 20:34.560
of the state

20:34.560 --> 20:35.140
of California

20:35.140 --> 20:36.080
you see what I mean

20:36.080 --> 20:37.140
so I know

20:37.140 --> 20:38.020
their root certificate

20:38.020 --> 20:38.860
I will verify

20:38.860 --> 20:39.920
the UC certificate

20:39.920 --> 20:40.940
then I will verify

20:40.940 --> 20:41.880
UCI certificate

20:41.880 --> 20:43.220
then I will verify

20:43.220 --> 20:44.000
your certificate

20:44.000 --> 20:45.160
make sure it's valid

20:45.160 --> 20:46.360
make sure it's not revoked

20:46.360 --> 20:46.960
right

20:46.960 --> 20:47.760
that kind of thing

20:47.760 --> 20:49.820
so that's still the case

20:49.820 --> 20:50.760
the client

20:50.760 --> 20:52.020
before this starts

20:52.020 --> 20:52.860
does not trust

20:52.860 --> 20:53.280
the service

20:53.280 --> 20:54.140
just knows the URL

20:54.140 --> 20:55.280
and so

20:55.280 --> 20:56.240
that remains

20:56.240 --> 20:56.900
in both versions

20:56.900 --> 20:58.100
the web

20:58.100 --> 20:59.020
the fundamentals

20:59.020 --> 20:59.760
of the web

20:59.760 --> 21:00.360
don't change

21:00.360 --> 21:01.280
but what we're saying

21:01.280 --> 21:02.020
now is a client

21:02.020 --> 21:02.540
for example

21:02.540 --> 21:03.140
can generate

21:03.140 --> 21:03.500
like

21:03.500 --> 21:04.880
think of it

21:04.880 --> 21:06.140
as a temporary

21:06.140 --> 21:06.800
public key

21:06.800 --> 21:07.140
there

21:07.140 --> 21:07.480
right

21:07.480 --> 21:08.380
where he knows

21:08.380 --> 21:09.160
the private key

21:09.160 --> 21:10.440
and what he does

21:10.440 --> 21:11.100
is he can now

21:11.100 --> 21:11.660
send a message

21:11.660 --> 21:12.780
with a public key

21:12.780 --> 21:14.800
to the server

21:14.800 --> 21:16.860
and he can say

21:16.860 --> 21:17.600
and by the way

21:17.600 --> 21:18.120
I do know

21:18.120 --> 21:18.800
the private key

21:18.800 --> 21:20.360
and how can you do this

21:20.360 --> 21:21.020
he can sign

21:21.020 --> 21:22.060
with a private key

21:22.060 --> 21:22.960
that message

21:22.960 --> 21:23.460
that includes

21:23.460 --> 21:24.000
the public key

21:24.000 --> 21:24.480
kind of it was

21:24.480 --> 21:25.620
essentially like

21:25.620 --> 21:26.620
a self-signed certificate

21:26.620 --> 21:27.980
the server said

21:27.980 --> 21:28.980
oh look that's cool

21:28.980 --> 21:29.520
because now

21:29.520 --> 21:30.220
you're not joking

21:30.220 --> 21:31.480
you're not messing around

21:31.480 --> 21:31.720
with me

21:31.720 --> 21:33.280
you know the key

21:33.280 --> 21:33.860
which you

21:33.860 --> 21:35.380
you know the private key

21:35.380 --> 21:36.140
for which the public key

21:36.140 --> 21:37.040
you'll be just sending me

21:37.040 --> 21:39.200
so then the server says

21:39.200 --> 21:40.880
okay now I have

21:40.880 --> 21:41.720
my own certificate

21:41.720 --> 21:42.760
here's my certificate

21:42.760 --> 21:43.780
oh maybe a chain

21:43.780 --> 21:44.340
of certificates

21:44.340 --> 21:47.180
and I only use RSA

21:47.180 --> 21:48.820
certificates can be signed

21:48.820 --> 21:49.220
with RSA

21:49.220 --> 21:50.900
but my public key

21:50.900 --> 21:51.660
is no longer RSA

21:51.660 --> 21:53.160
it's some kind of

21:53.160 --> 21:53.900
D.K. Hellman type

21:53.900 --> 21:54.400
public key

21:54.400 --> 21:55.100
which can be used

21:55.100 --> 21:56.180
for many things

21:56.180 --> 21:56.420
but

21:56.420 --> 21:58.380
there it is

21:58.380 --> 21:59.380
so now

21:59.380 --> 22:01.580
a server has a public key

22:01.580 --> 22:02.360
from the form

22:02.360 --> 22:03.400
remember G to the B

22:03.400 --> 22:03.920
or something

22:03.920 --> 22:05.220
and the client

22:05.220 --> 22:06.160
has a public key

22:06.160 --> 22:07.680
remember G to the A

22:07.680 --> 22:08.300
and then they can

22:08.300 --> 22:08.960
each compute

22:08.960 --> 22:09.800
G to the A B

22:09.800 --> 22:12.160
okay

22:12.160 --> 22:13.840
so that's basically

22:13.840 --> 22:14.420
the idea

22:14.420 --> 22:15.180
and

22:15.180 --> 22:17.740
when the server

22:17.740 --> 22:18.500
receives that message

22:18.500 --> 22:18.840
one

22:18.840 --> 22:19.980
he's able to

22:19.980 --> 22:20.480
compute the key

22:20.480 --> 22:20.880
right away

22:20.880 --> 22:21.660
because

22:21.660 --> 22:22.560
he knows his

22:22.560 --> 22:23.020
you know

22:23.020 --> 22:23.920
he knows B

22:23.920 --> 22:24.340
right

22:24.340 --> 22:25.260
that's his private key

22:25.260 --> 22:26.620
and he receives

22:26.620 --> 22:27.320
G to the A

22:27.320 --> 22:28.420
so right away

22:28.420 --> 22:29.020
he knows it

22:29.020 --> 22:30.440
and in that second message

22:30.440 --> 22:31.540
the second green message

22:31.540 --> 22:32.680
he can already sign

22:32.680 --> 22:34.340
using that key

22:34.340 --> 22:34.860
or MAC

22:34.860 --> 22:35.160
okay

22:35.160 --> 22:36.040
so that message

22:36.040 --> 22:36.480
can be secure

22:36.480 --> 22:37.300
they already have

22:37.300 --> 22:38.680
a secret

22:38.680 --> 22:40.100
in common

22:40.100 --> 22:46.480
so

22:46.480 --> 22:47.340
what is

22:47.340 --> 22:47.700
yeah

22:47.700 --> 22:49.600
I would like to know

22:49.600 --> 22:51.760
for the client

22:51.760 --> 22:53.940
when the client

22:53.940 --> 22:54.820
decide to

22:54.820 --> 22:55.620
choose the

22:55.620 --> 22:56.720
TS 1.2

22:56.720 --> 22:57.600
and 1.2

22:57.600 --> 22:58.120
so

22:58.120 --> 22:58.460
so

22:58.460 --> 22:59.380
this is

22:59.380 --> 23:02.640
the client

23:02.640 --> 23:03.200
hello

23:03.200 --> 23:05.640
did you get

23:05.640 --> 23:07.240
that announcement

23:07.240 --> 23:07.720
I posted

23:07.720 --> 23:09.060
yes

23:09.060 --> 23:09.940
did you see

23:09.940 --> 23:10.440
that announcement

23:10.440 --> 23:11.080
I posted

23:11.080 --> 23:11.740
about this

23:11.740 --> 23:12.700
there's a very cute

23:12.700 --> 23:13.380
little site

23:13.380 --> 23:14.900
that if you expand

23:14.900 --> 23:15.420
everything

23:15.420 --> 23:17.140
it will tell you

23:17.140 --> 23:18.320
in excruciating

23:18.320 --> 23:19.240
detail

23:19.240 --> 23:20.480
everything

23:20.480 --> 23:21.080
you want to know

23:21.080 --> 23:21.500
about this

23:21.500 --> 23:22.080
now

23:22.080 --> 23:22.600
if you

23:22.600 --> 23:23.540
in that pointer

23:23.540 --> 23:24.420
that I sent you

23:24.420 --> 23:25.600
link

23:25.600 --> 23:25.900
right

23:25.900 --> 23:27.860
there's a 1.2

23:27.860 --> 23:29.460
if you substitute

23:29.460 --> 23:30.440
with 1.3

23:30.440 --> 23:32.020
you will see

23:32.020 --> 23:32.560
the same

23:32.560 --> 23:33.460
gory details

23:33.460 --> 23:34.660
of a 1.3

23:34.660 --> 23:35.100
handshake

23:35.100 --> 23:37.080
okay

23:37.080 --> 23:37.660
now

23:37.660 --> 23:38.540
the difference is

23:38.540 --> 23:39.080
the client

23:39.080 --> 23:39.380
hello

23:39.380 --> 23:39.960
is present

23:39.960 --> 23:40.680
in all of them

23:40.680 --> 23:41.700
so

23:41.700 --> 23:42.420
at the client

23:42.420 --> 23:43.100
hello stage

23:43.100 --> 23:44.160
the first thing

23:44.160 --> 23:44.780
that the server

23:44.780 --> 23:45.420
sees is

23:45.420 --> 23:46.540
the setup

23:46.540 --> 23:47.340
or the highest

23:47.340 --> 23:48.260
version

23:48.260 --> 23:49.180
that the client

23:49.180 --> 23:49.800
is supporting

23:49.800 --> 23:52.000
so if the client

23:52.000 --> 23:52.660
specifies

23:52.660 --> 23:53.440
the highest version

23:53.440 --> 23:54.020
he supports

23:54.020 --> 23:54.920
is 1.2

23:54.920 --> 23:56.360
that server

23:56.360 --> 23:56.600
says

23:56.600 --> 23:57.060
okay

23:57.060 --> 23:59.360
if I'm allowed

23:59.360 --> 24:00.760
for example

24:00.760 --> 24:01.140
the server

24:01.140 --> 24:01.420
could be

24:01.420 --> 24:01.980
federal government

24:01.980 --> 24:02.260
saying

24:02.260 --> 24:02.880
go away

24:02.880 --> 24:03.960
I don't

24:03.960 --> 24:05.160
I don't talk

24:05.160 --> 24:05.740
to anybody

24:05.740 --> 24:06.660
who doesn't

24:06.660 --> 24:07.380
speak the latest

24:07.380 --> 24:07.760
version

24:07.760 --> 24:08.580
okay

24:08.580 --> 24:09.920
but if it's

24:09.920 --> 24:10.400
an e-commerce

24:10.400 --> 24:10.840
site

24:10.840 --> 24:11.320
they're like

24:11.320 --> 24:11.840
I don't

24:11.840 --> 24:12.540
sell this one

24:12.540 --> 24:13.500
I don't care

24:13.500 --> 24:14.120
if you're using

24:14.120 --> 24:14.760
the latest version

24:14.760 --> 24:16.380
so it will say

24:16.380 --> 24:16.760
okay

24:16.760 --> 24:17.880
1.2 is fine

24:17.880 --> 24:19.480
you see what I mean

24:19.480 --> 24:20.540
if the client

24:20.540 --> 24:20.940
says

24:20.940 --> 24:21.580
oh

24:21.580 --> 24:22.260
1.3

24:22.260 --> 24:22.880
in the client

24:22.880 --> 24:23.740
the server

24:23.740 --> 24:24.340
could say

24:24.340 --> 24:25.640
yeah

24:25.640 --> 24:26.480
but I'm in

24:26.480 --> 24:27.280
I don't know

24:27.280 --> 24:28.960
Slabonia

24:28.960 --> 24:29.700
and we don't

24:29.700 --> 24:30.740
speak 1.3

24:30.740 --> 24:31.300
here yet

24:31.300 --> 24:32.340
we're still

24:32.340 --> 24:32.860
like living

24:32.860 --> 24:33.620
10 years ago

24:33.620 --> 24:35.200
so then

24:35.200 --> 24:35.980
we regress

24:35.980 --> 24:36.800
to 1.2

24:36.800 --> 24:38.120
you see what I mean

24:38.120 --> 24:38.660
so server will

24:38.660 --> 24:39.160
reply with

24:39.160 --> 24:39.840
1.2

24:39.840 --> 24:41.600
but yeah

24:41.600 --> 24:43.200
for the previous

24:43.200 --> 24:43.600
slide

24:43.600 --> 24:45.780
yeah

24:45.780 --> 24:46.880
for the previous

24:46.880 --> 24:47.080
slide

24:47.080 --> 24:47.780
it seems that

24:47.780 --> 24:48.340
the client

24:48.340 --> 24:48.940
sent more

24:48.940 --> 24:49.520
message

24:49.520 --> 24:50.000
if it

24:50.000 --> 24:50.380
uses

24:50.380 --> 24:51.320
1.3

24:51.320 --> 24:52.060
so if

24:52.060 --> 24:52.480
no

24:52.480 --> 24:52.760
no

24:52.760 --> 24:53.640
less

24:53.640 --> 24:54.060
less

24:54.060 --> 24:54.300
because

24:54.300 --> 24:54.680
look

24:54.680 --> 24:56.080
both of them

24:56.080 --> 24:56.280
say

24:56.280 --> 24:56.840
client

24:56.840 --> 24:57.080
hello

24:57.080 --> 24:57.420
right

24:57.420 --> 24:58.700
but the client

24:58.700 --> 24:58.980
hello

24:58.980 --> 24:59.680
is not exactly

24:59.680 --> 25:00.120
the same

25:00.120 --> 25:00.620
if you look

25:00.620 --> 25:00.840
at the

25:00.840 --> 25:01.360
that's why

25:01.360 --> 25:01.680
I told you

25:01.680 --> 25:02.080
if you look

25:02.080 --> 25:02.800
go into that

25:02.800 --> 25:03.240
website

25:03.240 --> 25:03.540
right

25:03.540 --> 25:04.800
and you compare

25:04.800 --> 25:05.360
the client

25:05.360 --> 25:05.720
hello

25:05.720 --> 25:06.440
messages

25:06.440 --> 25:07.020
for both

25:07.020 --> 25:07.580
1.2

25:07.580 --> 25:07.860
and 1.3

25:07.860 --> 25:08.140
they're not

25:08.140 --> 25:08.780
exactly the same

25:08.780 --> 25:09.740
but the beginning

25:09.740 --> 25:10.400
is the same

25:10.400 --> 25:13.000
do you see what I mean

25:13.000 --> 25:13.940
they are the same

25:13.940 --> 25:14.460
in the beginning

25:14.460 --> 25:15.220
so

25:15.220 --> 25:16.340
if you

25:16.340 --> 25:17.080
if the client

25:17.080 --> 25:17.460
hello

25:17.460 --> 25:18.880
is a 1.2

25:18.880 --> 25:19.260
hello

25:19.260 --> 25:20.500
the server

25:20.500 --> 25:21.400
will realize

25:21.400 --> 25:21.820
that

25:21.820 --> 25:23.580
you see what I mean

25:23.580 --> 25:24.720
so if the client

25:24.720 --> 25:25.960
is willing to speak

25:25.960 --> 25:26.580
1.3

25:26.580 --> 25:27.140
the client

25:27.140 --> 25:27.380
hello

25:27.380 --> 25:28.480
should be 1.3

25:28.480 --> 25:29.760
if the client

25:29.760 --> 25:30.060
hello

25:30.060 --> 25:31.160
the client speaks

25:31.160 --> 25:32.160
only 1.2

25:32.160 --> 25:33.240
up to 1.2

25:33.240 --> 25:33.640
he will

25:33.640 --> 25:35.040
it will be 1.2

25:35.040 --> 25:35.480
but the server

25:35.480 --> 25:36.020
will recognize

25:36.020 --> 25:36.360
by looking

25:36.360 --> 25:37.000
in the first byte

25:37.000 --> 25:38.600
yeah

25:38.600 --> 25:47.040
so

25:47.040 --> 25:49.080
no

25:49.080 --> 25:49.840
because

25:49.840 --> 25:50.700
the server

25:50.700 --> 25:51.180
will simply

25:51.180 --> 25:52.000
reply that

25:52.000 --> 25:52.800
my check

25:52.800 --> 25:53.380
cipher spec

25:53.380 --> 25:53.960
I will pick

25:53.960 --> 25:54.560
1.2

25:54.560 --> 25:55.040
now

25:55.040 --> 25:56.380
don't quote me

25:56.380 --> 25:56.700
on this

25:56.700 --> 26:00.020
but I think

26:00.020 --> 26:01.020
one is a superset

26:01.020 --> 26:01.500
of the other

26:01.500 --> 26:02.260
so it's still

26:02.260 --> 26:02.780
parsable

26:02.780 --> 26:04.360
you don't have

26:04.360 --> 26:04.860
to trust me

26:04.860 --> 26:05.460
you have to trust

26:05.460 --> 26:06.100
all these hundreds

26:06.100 --> 26:06.500
of people

26:06.500 --> 26:06.920
that work

26:06.920 --> 26:07.160
on this

26:07.160 --> 26:07.620
to make sure

26:07.620 --> 26:08.600
because it's all

26:08.600 --> 26:10.620
made for programmers

26:10.620 --> 26:11.020
right

26:11.020 --> 26:12.120
it was all

26:12.120 --> 26:12.960
made for people

26:12.960 --> 26:14.260
to make it easy

26:14.260 --> 26:14.940
to code

26:14.940 --> 26:15.920
to parse things

26:15.920 --> 26:16.740
right

26:16.740 --> 26:17.360
so even if

26:17.360 --> 26:18.600
the format

26:18.600 --> 26:19.060
changes

26:19.060 --> 26:19.960
the preamble

26:19.960 --> 26:20.800
almost never

26:20.800 --> 26:21.220
changes

26:21.220 --> 26:23.120
right

26:23.120 --> 26:24.640
so you should

26:24.640 --> 26:25.000
be looking

26:25.000 --> 26:25.380
at like

26:25.380 --> 26:26.080
the very

26:26.080 --> 26:27.320
first few

26:27.320 --> 26:28.020
fields

26:28.020 --> 26:28.820
in the header

26:28.820 --> 26:29.620
and say

26:29.620 --> 26:30.120
ah

26:30.120 --> 26:31.480
that will tell

26:31.480 --> 26:32.040
me the version

26:32.040 --> 26:33.460
right

26:33.460 --> 26:34.040
and if I don't

26:34.040 --> 26:34.940
support this version

26:34.940 --> 26:35.540
then I can't

26:35.540 --> 26:36.460
then it's an error

26:36.460 --> 26:37.460
but if I can't

26:37.460 --> 26:38.320
support this version

26:38.320 --> 26:39.080
then we can

26:39.080 --> 26:39.720
downgrade

26:39.720 --> 26:41.220
right

26:41.220 --> 26:43.860
if my policy

26:43.860 --> 26:44.600
allows me

26:44.600 --> 26:45.800
right

26:45.800 --> 26:46.840
so for example

26:46.840 --> 26:47.200
maybe

26:47.200 --> 26:48.640
that depends

26:48.640 --> 26:49.080
very much

26:49.080 --> 26:49.480
on web

26:49.480 --> 26:49.900
web

26:49.900 --> 26:50.240
web

26:50.240 --> 26:50.560
web

26:50.560 --> 26:50.860
web service

26:50.860 --> 26:51.400
policy

26:51.400 --> 26:52.940
whether it's

26:52.940 --> 26:53.620
like a client

26:53.620 --> 26:54.120
might come

26:54.120 --> 26:54.560
from

26:54.560 --> 26:55.800
within the

26:55.800 --> 26:56.040
US

26:56.040 --> 26:57.200
and say

26:57.200 --> 26:57.600
I speak

26:57.600 --> 26:58.240
1.2

26:58.240 --> 26:58.660
and the web

26:58.660 --> 26:59.280
server says

26:59.280 --> 26:59.740
okay

26:59.740 --> 27:00.960
I'll speak

27:00.960 --> 27:01.560
1.2

27:01.560 --> 27:01.920
with you

27:01.920 --> 27:02.920
and the client

27:02.920 --> 27:03.640
comes over

27:03.640 --> 27:04.600
from Botswana

27:04.600 --> 27:06.100
and the server

27:06.100 --> 27:06.380
says

27:06.380 --> 27:06.940
uh-uh

27:06.940 --> 27:08.660
I don't

27:08.660 --> 27:09.440
trust Botswana

27:09.440 --> 27:10.460
I don't know

27:10.460 --> 27:10.780
where the hell

27:10.780 --> 27:11.160
you are

27:11.160 --> 27:11.820
really

27:11.820 --> 27:13.020
so for foreign

27:13.020 --> 27:13.540
clients

27:13.540 --> 27:13.960
I will

27:13.960 --> 27:14.480
bunk with

27:14.480 --> 27:15.020
three or nothing

27:15.020 --> 27:16.680
it's totally

27:16.680 --> 27:17.040
fine

27:17.040 --> 27:17.980
to do that

27:17.980 --> 27:21.640
so primarily

27:21.640 --> 27:22.380
what do we

27:22.380 --> 27:22.740
use this

27:22.740 --> 27:23.080
to sell

27:23.080 --> 27:23.440
for

27:23.440 --> 27:24.820
I mean

27:24.820 --> 27:25.280
the primary

27:25.280 --> 27:25.640
thing

27:25.640 --> 27:26.280
has always

27:26.280 --> 27:26.660
been

27:26.660 --> 27:27.540
some kind

27:27.540 --> 27:28.180
of e-commerce

27:28.180 --> 27:30.080
right

27:30.080 --> 27:31.600
because

27:31.600 --> 27:32.260
we're buying

27:32.260 --> 27:32.620
stuff

27:32.620 --> 27:34.240
right

27:34.240 --> 27:34.760
internet

27:34.760 --> 27:35.500
was built

27:35.500 --> 27:36.060
essentially

27:36.060 --> 27:36.760
on e-commerce

27:36.760 --> 27:38.360
internet

27:38.360 --> 27:38.860
of today

27:38.860 --> 27:39.260
not

27:39.260 --> 27:40.000
the original

27:40.000 --> 27:40.300
internet

27:40.300 --> 27:41.260
I would say

27:41.260 --> 27:41.980
sorry

27:41.980 --> 27:42.800
correction

27:42.800 --> 27:43.480
the web

27:43.480 --> 27:45.020
right

27:45.020 --> 27:45.720
the driving force

27:45.720 --> 27:46.120
of the web

27:46.120 --> 27:46.820
is e-commerce

27:46.820 --> 27:50.620
so

27:50.620 --> 27:51.280
as I

27:51.280 --> 27:52.180
already motivated

27:52.180 --> 27:52.500
before

27:52.500 --> 27:53.340
client-less education

27:53.340 --> 27:53.760
is generally

27:53.760 --> 27:54.340
not needed

27:54.340 --> 27:55.440
why

27:55.440 --> 27:56.500
well because

27:56.500 --> 27:57.360
with what

27:57.360 --> 27:57.680
right

27:57.680 --> 27:58.380
you're going

27:58.380 --> 27:58.900
to an e-commerce

27:58.900 --> 27:59.340
site

27:59.340 --> 28:00.220
you're buying

28:00.220 --> 28:00.840
widgets

28:00.840 --> 28:01.620
from

28:01.620 --> 28:02.460
ADC

28:02.460 --> 28:03.080
incorporated

28:03.080 --> 28:03.960
and you may

28:03.960 --> 28:04.280
have never

28:04.280 --> 28:04.660
visited

28:04.660 --> 28:05.100
ADC

28:05.100 --> 28:05.600
incorporated

28:05.600 --> 28:06.240
you're

28:06.240 --> 28:06.960
bargain shopping

28:06.960 --> 28:07.240
right

28:07.240 --> 28:07.780
using google

28:07.780 --> 28:08.440
saying compare

28:08.440 --> 28:08.820
prices

28:08.820 --> 28:09.920
oh look at

28:09.920 --> 28:10.220
that

28:10.220 --> 28:11.060
a company

28:11.060 --> 28:11.740
in Kravistan

28:11.740 --> 28:12.580
all right

28:12.580 --> 28:13.600
cheap stuff

28:13.600 --> 28:14.120
let me get

28:14.120 --> 28:14.360
it

28:14.360 --> 28:15.820
they don't

28:15.820 --> 28:16.140
know you

28:16.140 --> 28:16.420
you don't

28:16.420 --> 28:16.880
know them

28:16.880 --> 28:18.000
okay

28:18.000 --> 28:18.520
so you

28:18.520 --> 28:19.000
authenticated

28:19.000 --> 28:19.280
them

28:19.280 --> 28:19.880
but why

28:19.880 --> 28:20.440
should you

28:20.440 --> 28:20.860
authenticate

28:20.860 --> 28:21.280
yourself

28:21.280 --> 28:21.840
as a client

28:21.840 --> 28:22.300
until you

28:22.300 --> 28:22.740
decide to

28:22.740 --> 28:23.000
buy

28:23.000 --> 28:24.360
and it's

28:24.360 --> 28:24.760
not really

28:24.760 --> 28:25.160
authentication

28:25.160 --> 28:25.700
that you're

28:25.700 --> 28:25.920
doing

28:25.920 --> 28:26.140
right

28:26.140 --> 28:26.540
you're just

28:26.540 --> 28:26.940
presenting

28:26.940 --> 28:27.360
a method

28:27.360 --> 28:27.840
of payment

28:27.840 --> 28:28.220
right

28:28.220 --> 28:29.120
which may be

28:29.120 --> 28:29.460
stolen

28:29.460 --> 28:31.180
as long as

28:31.180 --> 28:31.600
it's valid

28:31.600 --> 28:32.400
the web server

28:32.400 --> 28:33.020
doesn't care

28:33.020 --> 28:34.420
all they want

28:34.420 --> 28:34.900
to make sure

28:34.900 --> 28:35.800
is that you

28:35.800 --> 28:36.260
will pay

28:36.260 --> 28:38.540
who you are

28:38.540 --> 28:39.060
they don't really

28:39.060 --> 28:39.380
care

28:39.380 --> 28:44.100
so if you're

28:44.100 --> 28:45.080
sending credit

28:45.080 --> 28:45.880
card information

28:45.880 --> 28:46.560
over

28:46.560 --> 28:47.320
of course

28:47.320 --> 28:47.800
that should be

28:47.800 --> 28:48.220
protected

28:48.220 --> 28:49.820
so that's what

28:49.820 --> 28:51.100
really SSL is for

28:51.100 --> 28:51.400
now

28:51.400 --> 28:52.820
it's also there

28:52.820 --> 28:53.360
to protect

28:53.360 --> 28:53.860
to you

28:53.860 --> 28:55.000
against evil

28:55.000 --> 28:55.940
web servers

28:55.940 --> 28:57.980
and that's

28:57.980 --> 28:58.340
where it

28:58.340 --> 28:58.860
transcends

28:58.860 --> 28:59.320
e-commerce

28:59.320 --> 29:00.180
when you go

29:00.180 --> 29:01.380
to CNN.com

29:01.380 --> 29:02.440
assuming you

29:02.440 --> 29:03.000
trust CNN

29:03.000 --> 29:04.140
or whatever

29:04.140 --> 29:04.600
your taste

29:04.600 --> 29:05.020
may be

29:05.020 --> 29:06.000
fox.com

29:06.000 --> 29:07.800
you want

29:07.800 --> 29:08.280
to get news

29:08.280 --> 29:08.860
from them

29:08.860 --> 29:09.460
and not

29:09.460 --> 29:10.160
from some

29:10.160 --> 29:11.400
belorussian

29:11.400 --> 29:13.440
government agency

29:13.440 --> 29:13.960
right

29:13.960 --> 29:15.440
or a north

29:15.440 --> 29:15.800
korean

29:15.800 --> 29:16.740
mouthpiece

29:16.740 --> 29:18.180
of what's

29:18.180 --> 29:18.520
his name

29:18.520 --> 29:19.560
you know

29:19.560 --> 29:21.360
so you

29:21.360 --> 29:21.860
want to get

29:21.860 --> 29:22.600
the real

29:22.600 --> 29:23.060
thing

29:23.060 --> 29:24.340
so in that

29:24.340 --> 29:24.940
case it's

29:24.940 --> 29:25.460
not money

29:25.460 --> 29:25.880
that's a

29:25.880 --> 29:26.140
stake

29:26.140 --> 29:26.860
it's authenticity

29:26.860 --> 29:27.340
right

29:27.340 --> 29:28.880
in that case

29:28.880 --> 29:29.960
nobody cares

29:29.960 --> 29:30.620
that you

29:30.620 --> 29:31.380
actually encrypt

29:31.380 --> 29:31.580
right

29:31.580 --> 29:32.240
in that case

29:32.240 --> 29:32.640
you may not

29:32.640 --> 29:33.360
even care about

29:33.360 --> 29:34.040
encrypting the

29:34.040 --> 29:34.220
data

29:34.220 --> 29:34.880
you care about

29:34.880 --> 29:35.460
authenticating

29:35.460 --> 29:35.840
the server

29:35.840 --> 29:36.480
maybe using

29:36.480 --> 29:37.960
null encryption

29:37.960 --> 29:40.540
make sense

29:40.540 --> 29:43.620
right

29:43.620 --> 29:46.320
of course

29:46.320 --> 29:47.480
SSL

29:47.480 --> 29:48.000
and TLS

29:48.000 --> 29:48.580
they're not

29:48.580 --> 29:49.000
magic

29:49.000 --> 29:49.220
right

29:49.220 --> 29:49.540
they're not

29:49.540 --> 29:49.880
going to do

29:49.880 --> 29:50.240
anything

29:50.240 --> 29:51.080
about like

29:51.080 --> 29:51.840
guaranteeing

29:51.840 --> 29:52.440
that if you

29:52.440 --> 29:53.020
send credit

29:53.020 --> 29:53.600
card data

29:53.600 --> 29:54.480
and shipping

29:54.480 --> 29:55.120
address

29:55.120 --> 29:55.540
or whatever

29:55.540 --> 29:56.700
they're not

29:56.700 --> 29:57.320
going to sell

29:57.320 --> 29:58.480
it to some

29:58.480 --> 30:00.120
mass marketer

30:00.120 --> 30:00.980
or some

30:00.980 --> 30:01.400
annoying

30:01.400 --> 30:02.200
telemarketer

30:02.200 --> 30:03.180
or just

30:03.180 --> 30:03.600
give it to

30:03.600 --> 30:04.040
somebody on

30:04.040 --> 30:04.440
the street

30:04.440 --> 30:04.880
to quickly

30:04.880 --> 30:05.520
buy 500

30:05.520 --> 30:06.180
pair of jeans

30:06.180 --> 30:07.200
you know

30:07.200 --> 30:07.820
you have no

30:07.820 --> 30:08.360
idea what's

30:08.360 --> 30:08.660
happening

30:08.660 --> 30:08.940
with your

30:08.940 --> 30:09.340
credit card

30:09.340 --> 30:09.860
you're just

30:09.860 --> 30:10.080
going to

30:10.080 --> 30:10.560
trust them

30:10.560 --> 30:10.800
that they

30:10.800 --> 30:11.300
will erase

30:11.300 --> 30:11.480
it

30:11.480 --> 30:11.860
or store

30:11.860 --> 30:12.020
it

30:12.020 --> 30:12.460
securely

30:12.460 --> 30:14.760
most

30:14.760 --> 30:15.280
clients

30:15.280 --> 30:15.900
of course

30:15.900 --> 30:16.260
have no

30:16.260 --> 30:16.520
idea

30:16.520 --> 30:16.820
what it

30:16.820 --> 30:17.040
means

30:17.040 --> 30:17.360
for a

30:17.360 --> 30:17.560
server

30:17.560 --> 30:18.040
certificate

30:18.040 --> 30:18.400
to even

30:18.400 --> 30:18.780
exist

30:18.780 --> 30:19.060
right

30:19.060 --> 30:19.320
most

30:19.320 --> 30:20.240
think about

30:20.240 --> 30:20.540
not

30:20.540 --> 30:21.000
yourselves

30:21.000 --> 30:21.380
because

30:21.380 --> 30:21.720
you're all

30:21.720 --> 30:22.160
super

30:22.160 --> 30:22.480
educated

30:22.480 --> 30:22.940
folks

30:22.940 --> 30:23.180
but

30:23.180 --> 30:23.560
think

30:23.560 --> 30:23.820
about

30:23.820 --> 30:24.240
various

30:24.240 --> 30:24.580
family

30:24.580 --> 30:25.020
members

30:25.020 --> 30:25.340
and

30:25.340 --> 30:25.640
you know

30:25.640 --> 30:25.960
some of

30:25.960 --> 30:26.080
them

30:26.080 --> 30:26.280
are

30:26.280 --> 30:26.960
children

30:26.960 --> 30:27.800
they don't

30:27.800 --> 30:28.000
know

30:28.000 --> 30:28.400
they use

30:28.400 --> 30:28.780
the web

30:28.780 --> 30:29.120
they use

30:29.120 --> 30:29.560
the internet

30:29.560 --> 30:29.980
they have

30:29.980 --> 30:30.420
no idea

30:30.420 --> 30:30.760
what it

30:30.760 --> 30:31.200
all means

30:31.200 --> 30:32.720
so we

30:32.720 --> 30:33.380
rely on

30:33.380 --> 30:33.740
conscious

30:33.740 --> 30:35.520
correct

30:35.520 --> 30:36.560
implementations

30:36.560 --> 30:37.280
to make

30:37.280 --> 30:37.720
sure

30:37.720 --> 30:38.280
that

30:38.280 --> 30:38.780
certificates

30:38.780 --> 30:39.380
are valid

30:39.380 --> 30:40.080
the certificates

30:40.080 --> 30:40.900
correspond to

30:40.900 --> 30:41.480
the websites

30:41.480 --> 30:42.060
that they're

30:42.060 --> 30:42.800
assigned to

30:42.800 --> 30:43.120
etc

30:43.120 --> 30:49.340
more importantly

30:49.340 --> 30:49.940
than

30:49.940 --> 30:52.020
e-commerce

30:52.020 --> 30:52.700
although that's

30:52.700 --> 30:53.340
not as much

30:53.340 --> 30:53.900
of a segment

30:53.900 --> 30:54.260
for

30:54.260 --> 30:54.980
application

30:54.980 --> 30:55.680
domain

30:55.680 --> 30:55.980
for

30:55.980 --> 30:56.940
CLS

30:56.940 --> 30:57.320
is

30:57.320 --> 30:57.740
banking

30:57.740 --> 30:58.140
and other

30:58.140 --> 30:58.640
financial

30:58.640 --> 30:59.240
services

30:59.240 --> 30:59.580
right

30:59.580 --> 31:00.760
it's kind

31:00.760 --> 31:00.860
of

31:00.860 --> 31:01.540
you can

31:01.540 --> 31:01.800
think of

31:01.800 --> 31:02.020
it as

31:02.020 --> 31:02.380
hyper

31:02.380 --> 31:02.840
e-commerce

31:02.840 --> 31:03.180
right

31:03.180 --> 31:03.520
this is

31:03.520 --> 31:03.840
where the

31:03.840 --> 31:04.080
money

31:04.080 --> 31:04.600
the real

31:04.600 --> 31:04.860
money

31:04.860 --> 31:05.000
is

31:05.000 --> 31:05.240
your

31:05.240 --> 31:05.580
money

31:05.580 --> 31:06.840
right

31:06.840 --> 31:07.580
here the

31:07.580 --> 31:07.940
bank is

31:07.940 --> 31:08.440
not selling

31:08.440 --> 31:08.960
you anything

31:08.960 --> 31:09.240
right

31:09.240 --> 31:09.720
you already

31:09.720 --> 31:10.420
decided to

31:10.420 --> 31:10.740
put your

31:10.740 --> 31:11.080
money in

31:11.080 --> 31:11.380
the bank

31:11.380 --> 31:11.600
and you

31:11.600 --> 31:11.900
have a

31:11.900 --> 31:12.420
relationship

31:12.420 --> 31:13.500
so instead

31:13.500 --> 31:13.960
of entering

31:13.960 --> 31:14.660
your credit

31:14.660 --> 31:15.080
card info

31:15.080 --> 31:15.800
actually here

31:15.800 --> 31:16.460
you do

31:16.460 --> 31:17.040
enter

31:17.040 --> 31:18.460
to begin

31:18.460 --> 31:18.900
a session

31:18.900 --> 31:19.180
with the

31:19.180 --> 31:19.380
bank

31:19.380 --> 31:19.780
you do

31:19.780 --> 31:20.220
enter

31:20.220 --> 31:20.600
your

31:20.600 --> 31:21.060
username

31:21.060 --> 31:21.680
password

31:21.680 --> 31:22.220
and god

31:22.220 --> 31:22.560
knows what

31:22.560 --> 31:22.840
else

31:22.840 --> 31:23.940
MFA

31:23.940 --> 31:24.360
right

31:24.360 --> 31:26.140
so

31:26.140 --> 31:26.880
there's

31:26.880 --> 31:27.120
more

31:27.120 --> 31:27.480
of a

31:27.480 --> 31:27.920
beginning

31:27.920 --> 31:28.180
of a

31:28.180 --> 31:28.420
session

31:28.420 --> 31:28.720
and end

31:28.720 --> 31:29.280
but notice

31:29.280 --> 31:29.700
that people

31:29.700 --> 31:30.060
go to

31:30.060 --> 31:30.400
banks

31:30.400 --> 31:30.960
also to

31:30.960 --> 31:31.340
browse

31:31.340 --> 31:31.640
let's

31:31.640 --> 31:31.840
say

31:31.840 --> 31:32.860
interest

31:32.860 --> 31:33.260
rates

31:33.260 --> 31:33.880
without

31:33.880 --> 31:34.340
having to

31:34.340 --> 31:34.700
log in

31:34.700 --> 31:35.900
so you

31:35.900 --> 31:36.320
do want

31:36.320 --> 31:36.580
to make

31:36.580 --> 31:36.960
sure you're

31:36.960 --> 31:37.260
going to

31:37.260 --> 31:37.680
the bank

31:37.680 --> 31:38.820
it's the

31:38.820 --> 31:39.340
right bank

31:39.340 --> 31:39.980
and it

31:39.980 --> 31:40.540
displays you

31:40.540 --> 31:41.040
truthful

31:41.040 --> 31:41.680
information

31:41.680 --> 31:42.600
so SSL

31:42.600 --> 31:43.120
TLS is

31:43.120 --> 31:43.660
useful there

31:43.660 --> 31:44.000
too

31:44.000 --> 31:44.680
right

31:44.680 --> 31:45.260
even without

31:45.260 --> 31:45.740
you logging

31:45.740 --> 31:46.100
in

31:46.100 --> 31:47.160
and authenticating

31:47.160 --> 31:47.600
yourself

31:47.600 --> 31:49.480
sometimes

31:49.480 --> 31:50.460
in early

31:50.460 --> 31:51.200
2000s

31:51.200 --> 31:52.220
mid 2000s

31:52.220 --> 31:53.420
some banks

31:53.420 --> 31:54.020
that were

31:54.020 --> 31:54.320
kind of

31:54.320 --> 31:54.560
hip

31:54.560 --> 31:54.740
and

31:54.740 --> 31:55.060
cool

31:55.060 --> 31:55.440
thought

31:55.440 --> 31:55.720
they

31:55.720 --> 31:56.740
would

31:56.740 --> 31:57.040
send

31:57.040 --> 31:57.900
customers

31:57.900 --> 31:58.720
I think

31:58.720 --> 31:59.020
I mentioned

31:59.020 --> 31:59.260
before

31:59.260 --> 31:59.800
like various

31:59.800 --> 32:00.280
dongles

32:00.280 --> 32:00.780
and USB

32:00.780 --> 32:01.140
keys

32:01.140 --> 32:01.440
and other

32:01.440 --> 32:01.760
things

32:01.760 --> 32:02.500
that you

32:02.500 --> 32:03.060
could use

32:03.060 --> 32:04.440
to upload

32:04.440 --> 32:04.960
a client

32:04.960 --> 32:05.540
certificate

32:05.540 --> 32:06.840
for SSL

32:06.840 --> 32:07.240
TLS

32:07.240 --> 32:08.360
that way

32:08.360 --> 32:08.640
you could

32:08.640 --> 32:08.940
have

32:08.940 --> 32:09.680
strong

32:09.680 --> 32:10.120
two-way

32:10.120 --> 32:10.720
authentication

32:10.720 --> 32:12.300
this

32:12.300 --> 32:12.660
somehow

32:12.660 --> 32:13.100
fell out

32:13.100 --> 32:13.220
of

32:13.220 --> 32:13.640
fashion

32:13.640 --> 32:16.860
okay

32:16.860 --> 32:17.580
that's

32:17.580 --> 32:18.500
the end

32:18.500 --> 32:18.700
of

32:18.700 --> 32:19.440
SSL

32:19.440 --> 32:19.940
TLS

32:19.940 --> 32:25.220
now we

32:25.220 --> 32:25.680
go on

32:25.680 --> 32:26.140
to

32:26.140 --> 32:28.100
another

32:28.100 --> 32:28.700
beautiful

32:28.700 --> 32:30.480
masterpiece

32:30.480 --> 32:34.060
IPsec

32:34.060 --> 32:41.840
quick show

32:41.840 --> 32:42.220
of hands

32:42.220 --> 32:43.060
how many

32:43.060 --> 32:43.600
people here

32:43.600 --> 32:44.260
have heard

32:44.260 --> 32:44.980
IPsec

32:44.980 --> 32:46.180
two

32:46.180 --> 32:46.480
three

32:46.480 --> 32:46.620
and

32:46.620 --> 32:46.800
well

32:46.800 --> 32:47.280
okay

32:47.280 --> 32:51.120
so

32:51.120 --> 32:51.700
IPsec

32:51.700 --> 32:52.320
is IP

32:52.320 --> 32:53.000
security

32:53.000 --> 32:53.520
extension

32:53.520 --> 32:55.940
strictly

32:55.940 --> 32:56.440
speaking

32:56.440 --> 32:57.040
unlike

32:57.040 --> 32:58.020
Carverus

32:58.020 --> 32:58.400
which is

32:58.400 --> 32:59.220
a system

32:59.220 --> 32:59.660
right

32:59.660 --> 33:00.540
Carverus

33:00.540 --> 33:00.800
remember

33:00.800 --> 33:01.560
e-system

33:01.560 --> 33:02.520
have

33:02.520 --> 33:02.760
many

33:02.760 --> 33:03.380
protocols

33:03.380 --> 33:03.800
right

33:03.800 --> 33:05.180
components

33:05.180 --> 33:07.080
SSL

33:07.080 --> 33:07.580
TLS

33:07.580 --> 33:08.460
is a

33:08.460 --> 33:09.340
protocol

33:09.340 --> 33:10.840
right

33:10.840 --> 33:11.160
our

33:11.160 --> 33:11.920
protocol suite

33:11.920 --> 33:12.260
really

33:12.260 --> 33:16.480
and a set

33:16.480 --> 33:16.980
of formats

33:16.980 --> 33:17.220
right

33:17.220 --> 33:17.600
the protocols

33:17.600 --> 33:18.600
always have

33:18.600 --> 33:19.040
formats

33:19.040 --> 33:19.600
for messages

33:19.600 --> 33:21.000
so

33:21.000 --> 33:21.740
IPsec

33:21.740 --> 33:22.720
strictly speaking

33:22.720 --> 33:23.580
is not

33:23.580 --> 33:23.980
a protocol

33:23.980 --> 33:26.200
it is

33:26.200 --> 33:26.840
actually

33:26.840 --> 33:27.740
a set

33:27.740 --> 33:28.340
of formats

33:28.340 --> 33:30.480
okay

33:30.480 --> 33:30.780
so

33:30.780 --> 33:31.100
this will

33:31.100 --> 33:31.340
become

33:31.340 --> 33:31.720
clear

33:31.720 --> 33:32.420
maybe a

33:32.420 --> 33:32.700
little bit

33:32.700 --> 33:33.100
puzzling

33:33.100 --> 33:33.320
at the

33:33.320 --> 33:33.580
moment

33:33.580 --> 33:34.220
become

33:34.220 --> 33:34.660
clear

33:34.660 --> 33:36.320
in a

33:36.320 --> 33:36.560
bit

33:36.560 --> 33:37.220
I hope

33:37.220 --> 33:38.360
so

33:38.360 --> 33:38.900
let's

33:38.900 --> 33:39.260
consider

33:39.260 --> 33:39.720
IP

33:39.720 --> 33:40.700
IP

33:40.700 --> 33:41.680
is the

33:41.680 --> 33:44.760
lingua franca

33:44.760 --> 33:46.140
the English

33:46.140 --> 33:46.880
of the internet

33:46.880 --> 33:47.240
right

33:47.240 --> 33:47.540
you want

33:47.540 --> 33:47.640
to

33:47.640 --> 33:49.680
communicate

33:49.680 --> 33:50.280
you kind of

33:50.280 --> 33:50.700
better speak

33:50.700 --> 33:50.980
English

33:50.980 --> 33:51.480
in the business

33:51.480 --> 33:52.060
world today

33:52.060 --> 33:52.360
well

33:52.360 --> 33:53.060
if you want

33:53.060 --> 33:53.500
to communicate

33:53.500 --> 33:53.920
today

33:53.920 --> 33:54.440
you need

33:54.440 --> 33:54.840
to speak

33:54.840 --> 33:55.180
IP

33:55.180 --> 33:55.660
you don't

33:55.660 --> 33:55.900
speak

33:55.900 --> 33:56.220
IP

33:56.220 --> 33:57.040
you are

33:57.040 --> 33:57.440
basically

33:57.440 --> 33:59.020
all right

33:59.020 --> 33:59.420
IP

33:59.420 --> 33:59.780
is the

33:59.780 --> 34:00.100
network

34:00.100 --> 34:00.540
layer

34:00.540 --> 34:00.940
it is

34:00.940 --> 34:01.340
what's

34:01.340 --> 34:01.500
called

34:01.500 --> 34:01.700
the

34:01.700 --> 34:02.100
thin

34:02.100 --> 34:02.780
waste

34:02.780 --> 34:03.580
because

34:03.580 --> 34:04.080
the internet

34:04.080 --> 34:04.660
has this

34:04.660 --> 34:04.980
kind of

34:04.980 --> 34:05.640
a

34:05.640 --> 34:07.760
what do you

34:07.760 --> 34:08.100
call it

34:08.100 --> 34:12.660
the hourglass

34:12.660 --> 34:13.480
the hourglass

34:13.480 --> 34:13.860
shape

34:13.860 --> 34:14.400
if you look

34:14.400 --> 34:14.620
at the

34:14.620 --> 34:15.020
protocols

34:15.020 --> 34:15.620
right

34:15.620 --> 34:16.440
there are

34:16.440 --> 34:17.600
many

34:17.600 --> 34:18.120
protocols

34:18.120 --> 34:19.440
why do I

34:19.440 --> 34:20.180
say hourglass

34:20.180 --> 34:20.720
right

34:20.720 --> 34:21.360
so

34:21.360 --> 34:28.080
so

34:28.080 --> 34:28.280
this

34:28.280 --> 34:28.420
will

34:28.420 --> 34:28.540
be

34:28.540 --> 34:28.960
physical

34:28.960 --> 34:29.420
layer

34:29.420 --> 34:30.760
data

34:30.760 --> 34:31.100
link

34:31.100 --> 34:32.800
and

34:32.800 --> 34:33.060
here

34:33.060 --> 34:33.320
is

34:33.320 --> 34:33.740
network

34:33.740 --> 34:34.100
layer

34:34.100 --> 34:34.960
here

34:34.960 --> 34:35.100
is

34:35.100 --> 34:35.300
where

34:35.300 --> 34:35.680
IP

34:35.680 --> 34:36.260
goes

34:36.260 --> 34:37.020
so

34:37.020 --> 34:37.400
here

34:37.400 --> 34:38.060
things

34:38.060 --> 34:38.260
get

34:38.260 --> 34:38.660
thicker

34:38.660 --> 34:39.220
and above

34:39.220 --> 34:39.620
IP

34:39.620 --> 34:40.080
let's

34:40.080 --> 34:40.240
say

34:40.240 --> 34:40.480
this

34:40.480 --> 34:40.620
is

34:40.620 --> 34:40.880
IP

34:40.880 --> 34:42.280
and

34:42.280 --> 34:42.580
above

34:42.580 --> 34:42.840
IP

34:42.840 --> 34:43.060
you

34:43.060 --> 34:43.360
have

34:43.360 --> 34:44.560
transport

34:44.560 --> 34:46.280
layer

34:46.280 --> 34:46.880
session

34:46.880 --> 34:47.480
layer

34:47.480 --> 34:48.100
so

34:48.100 --> 34:48.440
I have a

34:48.440 --> 34:49.020
presentation

34:49.020 --> 34:49.740
application

34:49.740 --> 34:50.180
whatever

34:50.180 --> 34:50.640
I forget

34:50.640 --> 34:50.880
that

34:50.880 --> 34:51.360
but

34:51.360 --> 34:51.600
they're

34:51.600 --> 34:51.780
all

34:51.780 --> 34:52.580
poorly

34:52.580 --> 34:53.500
demarcated

34:53.500 --> 34:55.020
here

34:55.020 --> 34:55.360
you have

34:55.360 --> 34:55.740
lots of

34:55.740 --> 34:56.200
applications

34:56.200 --> 34:56.560
right

34:56.560 --> 34:58.020
lots and

34:58.020 --> 34:58.380
lots of

34:58.380 --> 34:58.840
applications

34:58.840 --> 35:00.480
below that

35:00.480 --> 35:00.820
also

35:00.820 --> 35:01.480
lots of

35:01.480 --> 35:01.920
applications

35:01.920 --> 35:02.240
like

35:02.240 --> 35:02.760
presentation

35:02.760 --> 35:03.380
platforms

35:03.380 --> 35:03.920
of various

35:03.920 --> 35:04.300
sorts

35:04.300 --> 35:06.580
and here

35:06.580 --> 35:07.080
below

35:07.080 --> 35:07.480
in the

35:07.480 --> 35:07.820
physical

35:07.820 --> 35:08.220
layer

35:08.220 --> 35:08.880
you have

35:08.880 --> 35:11.200
Wi-Fi

35:11.200 --> 35:12.620
Zigbee

35:12.620 --> 35:13.560
Bluetooth

35:13.560 --> 35:14.760
NFC

35:14.760 --> 35:15.580
cellular

35:15.580 --> 35:17.200
right

35:17.200 --> 35:18.320
you have

35:18.320 --> 35:19.000
right

35:19.000 --> 35:19.360
all these

35:19.360 --> 35:20.040
fiber

35:20.040 --> 35:20.720
optics

35:20.720 --> 35:22.260
twisted

35:22.260 --> 35:22.800
copper

35:22.800 --> 35:24.240
god

35:24.240 --> 35:24.480
knows

35:24.480 --> 35:24.740
what

35:24.740 --> 35:25.020
oh

35:25.020 --> 35:25.960
radar

35:25.960 --> 35:27.840
infrared

35:27.840 --> 35:28.900
right

35:28.900 --> 35:29.360
all these

35:29.360 --> 35:29.740
ways of

35:29.740 --> 35:30.200
communication

35:30.200 --> 35:30.580
so

35:30.580 --> 35:30.760
there are

35:30.760 --> 35:31.340
many choices

35:31.340 --> 35:31.720
here

35:31.720 --> 35:32.280
many choices

35:32.280 --> 35:32.620
here

35:32.620 --> 35:33.260
as the

35:33.260 --> 35:33.520
network

35:33.520 --> 35:33.800
layer

35:33.800 --> 35:34.040
on the

35:34.040 --> 35:34.300
internet

35:34.300 --> 35:34.820
no

35:34.820 --> 35:35.180
choice

35:35.180 --> 35:37.100
IP

35:37.100 --> 35:37.280
or

35:37.280 --> 35:37.620
nothing

35:37.620 --> 35:39.720
that's

35:39.720 --> 35:39.960
what it's

35:39.960 --> 35:40.140
called

35:40.140 --> 35:40.280
the

35:40.280 --> 35:40.480
thin

35:40.480 --> 35:40.800
waste

35:40.800 --> 35:44.740
so

35:44.740 --> 35:45.720
as I

35:45.720 --> 35:45.960
said

35:45.960 --> 35:46.420
before

35:46.420 --> 35:46.880
IP

35:46.880 --> 35:47.120
was

35:47.120 --> 35:47.700
designed

35:47.700 --> 35:48.360
started

35:48.360 --> 35:48.740
around

35:48.740 --> 35:49.520
1976

35:49.520 --> 35:50.020
the

35:50.020 --> 35:50.360
design

35:50.360 --> 35:50.540
was

35:50.540 --> 35:50.980
finalized

35:50.980 --> 35:51.200
around

35:51.200 --> 35:51.720
1980

35:51.720 --> 35:52.300
or

35:52.300 --> 35:52.700
81

35:52.700 --> 35:54.000
most

35:54.000 --> 35:54.320
of the

35:54.320 --> 35:54.580
work

35:54.580 --> 35:54.760
in

35:54.760 --> 35:55.180
designing

35:55.180 --> 35:55.520
IP

35:55.520 --> 35:55.840
was

35:55.840 --> 35:56.100
done

35:56.100 --> 35:56.540
actually

35:56.540 --> 35:56.860
not

35:56.860 --> 35:57.140
far

35:57.140 --> 35:57.360
from

35:57.360 --> 35:57.800
here

35:57.800 --> 35:59.200
the

35:59.200 --> 35:59.500
place

35:59.500 --> 35:59.660
I

35:59.660 --> 35:59.900
once

35:59.900 --> 36:00.320
worked

36:00.320 --> 36:01.000
it's called

36:01.000 --> 36:01.660
ISI

36:01.660 --> 36:02.180
information

36:02.180 --> 36:02.700
sciences

36:02.700 --> 36:03.340
institute

36:03.340 --> 36:04.060
part of

36:04.060 --> 36:04.520
USC

36:04.520 --> 36:05.020
school

36:05.020 --> 36:05.180
of

36:05.180 --> 36:05.600
engineering

36:05.600 --> 36:06.640
beautifully

36:06.640 --> 36:07.200
situated

36:07.200 --> 36:07.900
far away

36:07.900 --> 36:08.100
from

36:08.100 --> 36:08.560
USC

36:08.560 --> 36:09.200
in

36:09.200 --> 36:09.460
Marina

36:09.460 --> 36:09.940
Del Rey

36:09.940 --> 36:10.320
on

36:10.320 --> 36:10.640
water

36:10.640 --> 36:12.100
inspiring

36:12.100 --> 36:12.760
people

36:12.760 --> 36:13.240
to work

36:13.240 --> 36:13.480
hard

36:13.480 --> 36:13.600
in

36:13.600 --> 36:13.840
course

36:13.840 --> 36:15.120
so

36:15.120 --> 36:16.320
true story

36:16.320 --> 36:17.020
I wasn't

36:17.020 --> 36:17.240
there

36:17.240 --> 36:17.760
I'm not

36:17.760 --> 36:18.120
that old

36:18.120 --> 36:19.540
but

36:19.540 --> 36:20.360
it was

36:20.360 --> 36:20.560
done

36:20.560 --> 36:20.760
a lot

36:20.760 --> 36:20.940
of it

36:20.940 --> 36:21.220
was done

36:21.220 --> 36:21.420
there

36:21.420 --> 36:21.980
at UCLA

36:21.980 --> 36:22.560
also

36:22.560 --> 36:24.480
there were

36:24.480 --> 36:24.700
some

36:24.700 --> 36:25.580
internet

36:25.580 --> 36:26.160
pioneers

36:26.160 --> 36:26.660
who designed

36:26.660 --> 36:26.980
some of

36:26.980 --> 36:27.180
this

36:27.180 --> 36:27.340
and

36:27.340 --> 36:27.860
DARPA

36:27.860 --> 36:28.580
which is a

36:28.580 --> 36:28.880
defense

36:28.880 --> 36:29.260
advanced

36:29.260 --> 36:29.620
research

36:29.620 --> 36:30.000
project

36:30.000 --> 36:30.520
agency

36:30.520 --> 36:32.380
funded

36:32.380 --> 36:32.900
all of

36:32.900 --> 36:33.180
this

36:33.180 --> 36:33.540
and

36:33.540 --> 36:33.820
without

36:33.820 --> 36:34.100
DARPA

36:34.100 --> 36:34.300
there

36:34.300 --> 36:34.380
would

36:34.380 --> 36:34.460
have

36:34.460 --> 36:34.580
been

36:34.580 --> 36:34.780
no

36:34.780 --> 36:35.140
internet

36:35.140 --> 36:37.560
anyway

36:37.560 --> 36:37.960
so

36:37.960 --> 36:38.240
it was

36:38.240 --> 36:38.700
designed

36:38.700 --> 36:39.800
to connect

36:39.800 --> 36:40.760
a bunch

36:40.760 --> 36:41.060
of

36:41.060 --> 36:41.820
routers

36:41.820 --> 36:42.160
switches

36:42.160 --> 36:42.700
computers

36:42.700 --> 36:43.000
and

36:43.000 --> 36:43.180
all

36:43.180 --> 36:43.500
people

36:43.500 --> 36:43.820
well

36:43.820 --> 36:44.080
to

36:44.080 --> 36:44.560
network

36:44.560 --> 36:45.420
and

36:45.420 --> 36:45.800
primary

36:45.800 --> 36:46.660
motivation

36:46.660 --> 36:47.040
back

36:47.040 --> 36:47.280
then

36:47.280 --> 36:47.440
for

36:47.440 --> 36:47.620
the

36:47.620 --> 36:47.980
internet

36:47.980 --> 36:48.440
was

36:48.440 --> 36:48.660
to

36:48.660 --> 36:49.220
access

36:49.220 --> 36:50.280
scarce

36:50.280 --> 36:51.060
resources

36:51.060 --> 36:52.280
remember

36:52.280 --> 36:53.040
back

36:53.040 --> 36:55.400
then

36:55.400 --> 36:56.260
you had

36:56.260 --> 36:56.820
computers

36:56.820 --> 36:57.420
most

36:57.420 --> 36:57.600
of

36:57.600 --> 36:57.720
them

36:57.720 --> 36:57.880
there

36:57.880 --> 36:57.980
were

36:57.980 --> 36:58.160
no

36:58.160 --> 36:58.460
personal

36:58.460 --> 36:58.780
computers

36:58.780 --> 36:58.980
first

36:58.980 --> 36:59.040
of

36:59.040 --> 36:59.160
all

36:59.160 --> 37:00.060
zero

37:00.060 --> 37:01.420
when

37:01.420 --> 37:01.740
FB

37:01.740 --> 37:01.900
was

37:01.900 --> 37:02.160
designed

37:02.160 --> 37:02.740
none

37:02.740 --> 37:03.580
not

37:03.580 --> 37:03.780
such

37:03.780 --> 37:03.860
a

37:03.860 --> 37:03.980
thing

37:03.980 --> 37:04.120
did

37:04.120 --> 37:04.300
not

37:04.300 --> 37:04.620
exist

37:04.620 --> 37:05.460
they

37:05.460 --> 37:05.660
were

37:05.660 --> 37:06.780
mid-range

37:06.780 --> 37:07.320
computers

37:07.320 --> 37:08.120
and they

37:08.120 --> 37:08.280
were

37:08.280 --> 37:08.580
like

37:08.580 --> 37:10.360
mainframes

37:10.360 --> 37:11.020
bigger

37:11.020 --> 37:11.520
computers

37:11.520 --> 37:12.240
and then

37:12.240 --> 37:12.720
the few

37:12.720 --> 37:13.200
here and

37:13.200 --> 37:13.460
there

37:13.460 --> 37:13.740
around

37:13.740 --> 37:13.880
the

37:13.880 --> 37:14.040
world

37:14.040 --> 37:15.060
supercomputers

37:15.060 --> 37:15.920
okay

37:15.920 --> 37:16.140
a

37:16.140 --> 37:16.480
supercomputer

37:16.480 --> 37:16.960
from

37:16.960 --> 37:17.220
back

37:17.220 --> 37:17.500
back

37:17.500 --> 37:17.720
then

37:17.720 --> 37:17.880
is

37:17.880 --> 37:18.020
an

37:18.020 --> 37:18.300
IoT

37:18.300 --> 37:18.680
device

37:18.680 --> 37:18.980
today

37:18.980 --> 37:20.040
in

37:20.040 --> 37:20.200
terms

37:20.200 --> 37:20.300
of

37:20.300 --> 37:20.400
its

37:20.400 --> 37:20.720
computing

37:20.720 --> 37:21.000
power

37:21.000 --> 37:22.480
but

37:22.480 --> 37:22.640
they

37:22.640 --> 37:22.860
were

37:22.860 --> 37:23.540
supercomputers

37:23.540 --> 37:23.680
and

37:23.680 --> 37:23.800
it

37:23.800 --> 37:24.000
took

37:24.000 --> 37:24.280
like

37:24.280 --> 37:24.480
a

37:24.480 --> 37:24.960
whole

37:24.960 --> 37:25.340
floor

37:25.340 --> 37:25.460
of

37:25.460 --> 37:25.840
building

37:25.840 --> 37:26.500
one

37:26.500 --> 37:26.800
computer

37:26.800 --> 37:29.560
because

37:29.560 --> 37:29.820
these

37:29.820 --> 37:30.220
resources

37:30.220 --> 37:30.480
were

37:30.480 --> 37:30.880
scarce

37:30.880 --> 37:31.120
and

37:31.120 --> 37:31.580
super

37:31.580 --> 37:31.920
duper

37:31.920 --> 37:32.400
expensive

37:32.400 --> 37:32.680
like

37:32.680 --> 37:33.140
gazillions

37:33.140 --> 37:33.340
of

37:33.340 --> 37:33.740
dollars

37:33.740 --> 37:35.480
they

37:35.480 --> 37:35.920
were

37:35.920 --> 37:36.400
precious

37:36.400 --> 37:36.740
right

37:36.740 --> 37:37.120
and people

37:37.120 --> 37:37.460
who wanted

37:37.460 --> 37:37.940
to perform

37:37.940 --> 37:38.760
large scale

37:38.760 --> 37:39.460
computation

37:39.460 --> 37:40.920
of any

37:40.920 --> 37:41.260
kind

37:41.260 --> 37:42.980
have to

37:42.980 --> 37:43.260
like

37:43.260 --> 37:43.880
buy

37:43.880 --> 37:44.400
time

37:44.400 --> 37:45.100
on those

37:45.100 --> 37:45.420
computers

37:45.420 --> 37:46.600
and

37:46.600 --> 37:46.760
if

37:46.760 --> 37:46.920
you

37:46.920 --> 37:47.660
do

37:47.660 --> 37:47.820
it

37:47.820 --> 37:47.940
you

37:47.940 --> 37:48.480
travel

37:48.480 --> 37:48.900
somewhere

37:48.900 --> 37:49.100
to

37:49.100 --> 37:49.280
use

37:49.280 --> 37:49.400
your

37:49.400 --> 37:49.800
computer

37:49.800 --> 37:50.660
right

37:50.660 --> 37:50.860
there

37:50.860 --> 37:51.320
physically

37:51.320 --> 37:51.800
but

37:51.800 --> 37:52.560
that's

37:52.560 --> 37:52.700
not

37:52.700 --> 37:53.060
scalable

37:53.060 --> 37:53.980
so

37:53.980 --> 37:54.220
people

37:54.220 --> 37:54.640
realize

37:54.640 --> 37:54.820
that

37:54.820 --> 37:54.940
if

37:54.940 --> 37:55.020
you

37:55.020 --> 37:55.160
want

37:55.160 --> 37:55.280
to

37:55.280 --> 37:55.400
have

37:55.400 --> 37:55.740
access

37:55.740 --> 37:56.160
remote

37:56.160 --> 37:56.560
access

37:56.560 --> 37:56.860
to

37:56.860 --> 37:57.840
resources

37:57.840 --> 37:58.220
like

37:58.220 --> 37:58.580
that

37:58.580 --> 37:59.020
you

37:59.020 --> 37:59.240
need

37:59.240 --> 37:59.380
to

37:59.380 --> 37:59.700
connect

37:59.700 --> 37:59.900
them

37:59.900 --> 38:00.240
somehow

38:00.240 --> 38:00.460
and

38:00.460 --> 38:00.780
dial

38:00.780 --> 38:01.020
up

38:01.020 --> 38:01.220
what

38:01.220 --> 38:01.760
existed

38:01.760 --> 38:02.900
modems

38:02.900 --> 38:03.280
remember

38:03.280 --> 38:03.680
modems

38:03.680 --> 38:03.940
maybe

38:03.940 --> 38:04.140
you've

38:04.140 --> 38:04.300
seen

38:04.300 --> 38:04.500
old

38:04.500 --> 38:04.780
movies

38:04.780 --> 38:05.000
go

38:05.000 --> 38:06.360
and

38:06.360 --> 38:07.020
there's

38:07.020 --> 38:07.100
a

38:07.100 --> 38:07.340
modem

38:07.340 --> 38:07.740
connection

38:07.740 --> 38:08.340
yeah

38:08.340 --> 38:08.480
it's

38:08.480 --> 38:08.600
not

38:08.600 --> 38:08.880
somebody

38:08.880 --> 38:09.100
having

38:09.100 --> 38:09.280
a

38:09.280 --> 38:09.540
cold

38:09.540 --> 38:10.720
well

38:10.720 --> 38:10.940
I

38:10.940 --> 38:11.180
still

38:11.180 --> 38:11.440
remember

38:11.440 --> 38:11.760
that

38:11.760 --> 38:12.620
and

38:12.620 --> 38:13.100
but

38:13.100 --> 38:13.260
that

38:13.260 --> 38:13.460
was

38:13.460 --> 38:14.000
totally

38:14.000 --> 38:14.380
terrible

38:14.380 --> 38:14.900
because

38:14.900 --> 38:15.080
you

38:15.080 --> 38:15.200
were

38:15.200 --> 38:15.580
using

38:15.580 --> 38:16.640
unstable

38:16.640 --> 38:17.080
telephone

38:17.080 --> 38:17.540
lines

38:17.540 --> 38:17.780
and

38:17.780 --> 38:18.200
terrible

38:18.200 --> 38:18.600
equipment

38:18.600 --> 38:19.780
so

38:19.780 --> 38:20.400
there was

38:20.400 --> 38:20.620
the idea

38:20.620 --> 38:21.060
to connect

38:21.060 --> 38:21.420
them all

38:21.420 --> 38:21.700
with

38:21.700 --> 38:22.140
dedicated

38:22.140 --> 38:22.780
lines

38:22.780 --> 38:24.300
okay

38:24.300 --> 38:24.720
so

38:24.720 --> 38:26.540
there you

38:26.540 --> 38:26.960
have the birth

38:26.960 --> 38:27.460
of the internet

38:27.460 --> 38:27.880
right

38:27.880 --> 38:28.520
and they

38:28.520 --> 38:28.920
needed a

38:28.920 --> 38:29.240
protocol

38:29.240 --> 38:30.140
that would

38:30.140 --> 38:30.580
basically

38:30.580 --> 38:31.060
break

38:31.060 --> 38:31.800
communication

38:31.800 --> 38:32.560
data

38:32.560 --> 38:33.140
arbitrary

38:33.140 --> 38:33.620
size

38:33.620 --> 38:34.160
into

38:34.160 --> 38:34.800
small

38:34.800 --> 38:35.240
uniform

38:35.240 --> 38:35.680
size

38:35.680 --> 38:36.100
chunks

38:36.100 --> 38:36.880
and

38:36.880 --> 38:37.260
transmit

38:37.260 --> 38:37.480
them

38:37.480 --> 38:37.720
hop

38:37.720 --> 38:38.100
by hop

38:38.100 --> 38:38.520
by hop

38:38.520 --> 38:39.020
by hop

38:39.020 --> 38:39.660
to their

38:39.660 --> 38:40.260
destination

38:40.260 --> 38:41.080
why

38:41.440 --> 38:41.680
hop

38:41.680 --> 38:41.940
because

38:41.940 --> 38:42.120
you

38:42.120 --> 38:42.380
couldn't

38:42.380 --> 38:42.840
have

38:42.840 --> 38:43.620
fully

38:43.620 --> 38:44.060
connected

38:44.060 --> 38:44.500
network

38:44.500 --> 38:44.860
right

38:44.860 --> 38:46.120
everybody

38:46.120 --> 38:46.600
connected

38:46.600 --> 38:46.780
to

38:46.780 --> 38:47.200
everything

38:47.200 --> 38:48.060
that would

38:48.060 --> 38:48.600
be incredibly

38:48.600 --> 38:49.120
expensive

38:49.120 --> 38:49.800
logistically

38:49.800 --> 38:50.400
nightmare

38:50.400 --> 38:51.560
right

38:51.560 --> 38:51.740
so

38:51.740 --> 38:51.980
they

38:51.980 --> 38:52.180
needed

38:52.180 --> 38:52.320
to

38:52.320 --> 38:52.600
connect

38:52.600 --> 38:52.720
them

38:52.720 --> 38:52.920
via

38:52.920 --> 38:53.580
switches

38:53.580 --> 38:54.240
routers

38:54.240 --> 38:55.400
right

38:55.400 --> 38:57.500
that scales

38:57.500 --> 38:59.520
so

38:59.520 --> 39:00.040
the internet

39:00.040 --> 39:00.740
protocol

39:00.740 --> 39:01.260
was designed

39:01.260 --> 39:01.580
for that

39:01.580 --> 39:02.040
to hop

39:02.040 --> 39:02.440
along

39:02.440 --> 39:02.820
these

39:02.820 --> 39:03.340
routers

39:03.340 --> 39:03.740
and switches

39:03.740 --> 39:04.140
until

39:04.140 --> 39:04.420
these

39:04.420 --> 39:04.760
get to

39:04.760 --> 39:04.900
the

39:04.900 --> 39:05.440
destination

39:05.440 --> 39:06.000
IP

39:06.000 --> 39:06.340
protocol

39:06.340 --> 39:06.620
does

39:06.620 --> 39:06.980
not

39:06.980 --> 39:07.820
actually

39:07.820 --> 39:08.320
perform

39:08.320 --> 39:08.820
the routing

39:08.820 --> 39:09.240
function

39:09.240 --> 39:09.820
it doesn't

39:09.820 --> 39:10.200
distribute

39:10.200 --> 39:10.680
routes

39:10.680 --> 39:11.800
okay

39:11.800 --> 39:12.400
that's done

39:12.400 --> 39:12.700
by what's

39:12.700 --> 39:12.840
called

39:12.840 --> 39:13.220
routing

39:13.220 --> 39:13.680
protocols

39:13.680 --> 39:14.260
which you

39:14.260 --> 39:14.500
should have

39:14.500 --> 39:14.860
learned in

39:14.860 --> 39:15.240
your networking

39:15.240 --> 39:15.620
course

39:15.620 --> 39:17.040
IP just

39:17.040 --> 39:17.640
forwards

39:17.640 --> 39:18.020
things

39:18.020 --> 39:20.100
all it

39:20.100 --> 39:20.440
knows

39:20.440 --> 39:21.020
is how

39:21.020 --> 39:21.220
to

39:21.220 --> 39:21.860
let the

39:21.860 --> 39:22.160
source

39:22.160 --> 39:22.820
generate

39:22.820 --> 39:23.240
the packet

39:23.240 --> 39:24.400
stick it

39:24.400 --> 39:24.600
on the

39:24.600 --> 39:24.880
wire

39:24.880 --> 39:25.540
give it

39:25.540 --> 39:25.780
to the

39:25.780 --> 39:26.200
data link

39:26.200 --> 39:26.380
layer

39:26.380 --> 39:26.760
below

39:26.760 --> 39:28.280
and then

39:28.280 --> 39:29.220
at the

39:29.220 --> 39:29.820
next hop

39:29.820 --> 39:30.720
whatever that

39:30.720 --> 39:31.340
hop might be

39:31.340 --> 39:31.760
it might be

39:31.760 --> 39:32.340
the destination

39:32.340 --> 39:33.120
or it might

39:33.120 --> 39:33.960
be a router

39:33.960 --> 39:35.220
pick that packet

39:35.220 --> 39:35.640
up saying

39:35.640 --> 39:36.000
hmm

39:36.000 --> 39:37.720
let's see

39:37.720 --> 39:39.040
destination

39:39.040 --> 39:39.480
I don't

39:39.480 --> 39:39.780
know this

39:39.780 --> 39:40.220
destination

39:40.220 --> 39:40.940
I am not

39:40.940 --> 39:41.580
that destination

39:41.580 --> 39:42.480
but I think

39:42.480 --> 39:43.160
somebody else

39:43.160 --> 39:43.580
I know

39:43.580 --> 39:44.280
knows where

39:44.280 --> 39:44.780
the destination

39:44.780 --> 39:45.020
is

39:45.020 --> 39:45.840
so you forward

39:45.840 --> 39:46.400
it to somebody

39:46.400 --> 39:46.940
else who knows

39:46.940 --> 39:47.280
better

39:47.280 --> 39:49.320
according to

39:49.320 --> 39:49.980
some routing

39:49.980 --> 39:50.280
data

39:50.280 --> 39:53.220
so back then

39:53.220 --> 39:53.580
the internet

39:53.580 --> 39:54.140
was small

39:54.140 --> 39:55.360
and very friendly

39:55.360 --> 39:56.660
it was populated

39:56.660 --> 39:58.580
by idealistic

39:58.580 --> 39:59.060
and naive

39:59.060 --> 39:59.460
geeks

39:59.460 --> 40:01.180
who just wanted

40:01.180 --> 40:01.640
to compute

40:01.640 --> 40:02.100
stuff

40:02.100 --> 40:03.200
right

40:03.200 --> 40:03.820
and they were

40:03.820 --> 40:04.560
not you know

40:04.560 --> 40:05.020
hostile

40:05.020 --> 40:05.720
I mean they were

40:05.720 --> 40:06.200
they could be

40:06.200 --> 40:06.440
hostile

40:06.440 --> 40:06.880
but they were

40:06.880 --> 40:07.980
not about

40:07.980 --> 40:08.460
to attack

40:08.460 --> 40:08.920
the internet

40:08.920 --> 40:09.880
the cow

40:09.880 --> 40:10.300
that feeds

40:10.300 --> 40:10.740
them all

40:10.740 --> 40:11.400
right

40:11.400 --> 40:12.640
it was all

40:12.640 --> 40:13.140
essentially

40:13.140 --> 40:14.100
research

40:14.100 --> 40:15.240
and almost

40:15.240 --> 40:15.800
no commercial

40:15.800 --> 40:16.540
use was allowed

40:16.540 --> 40:17.260
on the internet

40:17.260 --> 40:18.380
until early 90s

40:18.380 --> 40:19.760
so for good

40:19.760 --> 40:20.300
like 12

40:20.300 --> 40:21.120
14 years

40:21.120 --> 40:22.660
there was no

40:22.660 --> 40:23.080
such thing

40:23.080 --> 40:23.520
as commerce

40:23.520 --> 40:24.040
on the internet

40:24.040 --> 40:26.720
and so

40:26.720 --> 40:27.580
from that

40:27.580 --> 40:28.420
small and

40:28.420 --> 40:29.120
friendly world

40:29.120 --> 40:30.720
we wound up

40:30.720 --> 40:31.240
what we have

40:31.240 --> 40:31.620
today

40:31.620 --> 40:32.780
essentially

40:32.780 --> 40:33.440
internet

40:33.440 --> 40:35.540
in many ways

40:35.540 --> 40:36.660
is a giant

40:36.660 --> 40:37.320
global sewer

40:37.320 --> 40:39.120
where everything

40:39.120 --> 40:39.480
goes

40:39.480 --> 40:39.940
and anything

40:39.940 --> 40:40.400
flies

40:40.400 --> 40:42.840
and back then

40:42.840 --> 40:43.460
all the hosts

40:43.460 --> 40:44.120
were known

40:44.120 --> 40:44.580
in fact

40:44.580 --> 40:45.100
if you were

40:45.100 --> 40:45.460
running a

40:45.460 --> 40:46.040
unix machine

40:46.040 --> 40:46.580
back then

40:46.580 --> 40:47.560
you didn't even

40:47.560 --> 40:48.380
need domain name

40:48.380 --> 40:48.700
service

40:48.700 --> 40:49.380
you could have

40:49.380 --> 40:50.060
what's a file

40:50.060 --> 40:50.360
called

40:50.360 --> 40:51.520
etc password

40:51.520 --> 40:52.340
there was a file

40:52.340 --> 40:53.200
called etc hosts

40:53.200 --> 40:54.840
and it actually

40:54.840 --> 40:56.200
listed one per line

40:56.200 --> 40:57.220
names

40:57.220 --> 40:58.620
and IP addresses

40:58.620 --> 40:59.620
of every host

40:59.620 --> 41:00.080
on the internet

41:00.080 --> 41:02.800
yeah

41:02.800 --> 41:04.200
I remember

41:04.200 --> 41:04.840
when I inherited

41:04.840 --> 41:05.300
my first

41:05.300 --> 41:05.520
machine

41:05.520 --> 41:07.420
in grad school

41:07.420 --> 41:08.440
it was like

41:08.440 --> 41:08.700
from

41:08.700 --> 41:09.320
the machine

41:09.320 --> 41:10.500
was older

41:10.500 --> 41:11.440
but it had

41:11.440 --> 41:11.980
this file

41:11.980 --> 41:13.200
and it had

41:13.200 --> 41:13.840
like I don't know

41:13.840 --> 41:15.340
5,000 entries

41:15.340 --> 41:16.260
and there were

41:16.260 --> 41:16.740
all the hosts

41:16.740 --> 41:17.220
on the internet

41:17.220 --> 41:18.880
that's it

41:18.880 --> 41:20.100
everywhere in the world

41:20.100 --> 41:22.160
the users

41:22.160 --> 41:23.260
were limited too

41:23.260 --> 41:23.680
right

41:23.680 --> 41:24.640
security was

41:24.640 --> 41:25.140
essentially

41:25.140 --> 41:25.860
not an issue

41:25.860 --> 41:26.360
back then

41:26.360 --> 41:28.260
in that world

41:28.260 --> 41:28.980
it was not an issue

41:28.980 --> 41:30.080
think of it

41:30.080 --> 41:30.540
as the internet

41:30.540 --> 41:31.560
was essentially

41:31.560 --> 41:32.800
like a hippie

41:32.800 --> 41:34.100
hippie-dippie

41:34.100 --> 41:35.580
private network

41:35.580 --> 41:37.160
you couldn't

41:37.160 --> 41:37.720
just like

41:37.720 --> 41:38.820
randomly hook up

41:38.820 --> 41:39.420
to the internet

41:39.420 --> 41:40.460
there was no

41:40.460 --> 41:40.920
wireless

41:40.920 --> 41:41.960
access

41:41.960 --> 41:42.780
zero

41:42.780 --> 41:44.080
okay

41:44.080 --> 41:45.840
the easiest way

41:45.840 --> 41:46.340
to work with

41:46.340 --> 41:46.640
the internet

41:46.640 --> 41:47.480
was to actually

41:47.480 --> 41:47.860
like

41:47.860 --> 41:50.340
use a

41:50.340 --> 41:50.860
wired

41:50.860 --> 41:51.480
ethernet

41:51.480 --> 41:51.900
right

41:51.900 --> 41:53.280
you have an

41:53.280 --> 41:53.900
ethernet port

41:53.900 --> 41:54.400
in the wall

41:54.400 --> 41:54.740
you

41:54.740 --> 41:55.600
start with

41:55.600 --> 41:55.920
wire

41:55.920 --> 41:56.240
and

41:56.240 --> 41:57.020
if you have

41:57.020 --> 41:57.700
internet access

41:57.700 --> 41:58.280
you can start

41:58.280 --> 41:58.480
doing

41:58.480 --> 42:01.820
well

42:01.820 --> 42:02.620
as you know

42:02.620 --> 42:03.120
the world has

42:03.120 --> 42:03.760
changed dramatically

42:03.760 --> 42:04.480
since then

42:04.480 --> 42:05.520
so

42:05.520 --> 42:06.680
security has

42:06.680 --> 42:07.360
become an issue

42:07.360 --> 42:07.820
now

42:07.820 --> 42:08.600
people were not

42:08.600 --> 42:09.460
totally naive

42:09.460 --> 42:09.800
already

42:09.800 --> 42:11.780
in the late 80s

42:11.780 --> 42:12.460
they started

42:12.460 --> 42:13.000
thinking about

42:13.000 --> 42:13.700
what will happen

42:13.700 --> 42:14.200
when the internet

42:14.200 --> 42:15.380
becomes available

42:15.380 --> 42:16.060
to the masses

42:16.060 --> 42:17.100
and becomes

42:17.100 --> 42:17.800
commercialized

42:17.800 --> 42:18.540
so

42:18.540 --> 42:19.520
hostility

42:19.520 --> 42:19.900
or

42:19.900 --> 42:20.780
essentially

42:20.780 --> 42:21.980
lack of security

42:21.980 --> 42:22.860
in the original

42:22.860 --> 42:23.180
internet

42:23.180 --> 42:23.680
was already

42:23.680 --> 42:24.580
a problem

42:24.580 --> 42:25.620
so what can

42:25.620 --> 42:25.980
you do with

42:25.980 --> 42:26.260
IP

42:26.260 --> 42:26.740
IP

42:26.740 --> 42:27.740
even if you

42:27.740 --> 42:28.000
don't know

42:28.000 --> 42:28.220
anything

42:28.220 --> 42:28.660
about it

42:28.660 --> 42:28.860
just

42:28.860 --> 42:29.900
trust me

42:29.900 --> 42:30.440
you will

42:30.440 --> 42:30.840
see the

42:30.840 --> 42:31.120
format

42:31.120 --> 42:32.300
in a minute

42:32.300 --> 42:34.840
allows very

42:34.840 --> 42:35.540
easy address

42:35.540 --> 42:36.020
spoofing

42:36.020 --> 42:36.820
so

42:36.820 --> 42:39.220
IP packets

42:39.220 --> 42:40.560
all have

42:40.560 --> 42:40.880
a header

42:40.880 --> 42:41.640
and a header

42:41.640 --> 42:42.060
says

42:42.060 --> 42:43.380
among other things

42:43.380 --> 42:44.040
where is this

42:44.040 --> 42:44.760
packet coming from

42:44.760 --> 42:45.180
and where is it

42:45.180 --> 42:45.600
going to

42:45.600 --> 42:46.580
otherwise it would

42:46.580 --> 42:47.240
make no sense

42:47.240 --> 42:49.640
at least the

42:49.640 --> 42:50.040
destination

42:50.040 --> 42:51.280
but the source

42:51.280 --> 42:52.580
is the spoofed

42:52.580 --> 42:53.700
the source is just

42:53.700 --> 42:54.440
an IP address

42:54.440 --> 42:55.340
IP address

42:55.340 --> 42:55.940
is not in the

42:55.940 --> 42:56.620
form of authentication

42:56.620 --> 42:57.600
it's just

42:57.600 --> 42:58.380
there

42:58.380 --> 43:00.100
right

43:00.100 --> 43:02.000
you can just

43:02.000 --> 43:02.340
like

43:02.340 --> 43:03.720
substitute it

43:03.720 --> 43:04.120
with some

43:04.120 --> 43:04.860
other IP address

43:04.860 --> 43:06.360
and so if you

43:06.360 --> 43:07.060
do some kind

43:07.060 --> 43:07.560
of filtering

43:07.560 --> 43:08.260
based on

43:08.260 --> 43:09.400
source IP

43:09.400 --> 43:09.820
addresses

43:09.820 --> 43:11.060
you're fooling

43:11.060 --> 43:11.360
yourself

43:11.360 --> 43:11.880
because it

43:11.880 --> 43:12.260
doesn't mean

43:12.260 --> 43:12.600
anything

43:12.600 --> 43:15.980
the source address

43:15.980 --> 43:16.700
why do we

43:16.700 --> 43:17.220
use the source

43:17.220 --> 43:17.400
address

43:17.400 --> 43:17.900
well because

43:17.900 --> 43:18.580
the destination

43:18.580 --> 43:19.080
when it wants

43:19.080 --> 43:19.520
to reply

43:19.520 --> 43:19.920
it needs to

43:19.920 --> 43:20.340
know where to

43:20.340 --> 43:20.620
reply

43:20.620 --> 43:21.200
so we still

43:21.200 --> 43:21.580
need the

43:21.580 --> 43:21.740
source

43:21.740 --> 43:22.060
in the

43:22.060 --> 43:22.240
kitchen

43:22.240 --> 43:25.960
most packets

43:25.960 --> 43:27.940
anybody can

43:27.940 --> 43:28.540
take a packet

43:28.540 --> 43:29.660
not touch

43:29.660 --> 43:30.780
the source

43:30.780 --> 43:31.120
address

43:31.120 --> 43:31.700
but modify

43:31.700 --> 43:32.360
the destination

43:32.360 --> 43:32.760
address

43:32.760 --> 43:33.620
or modify

43:33.620 --> 43:35.080
the payload

43:35.080 --> 43:35.480
right

43:35.480 --> 43:35.900
the data

43:35.900 --> 43:37.140
just pick

43:37.140 --> 43:37.740
something up

43:37.740 --> 43:39.740
yeah

43:39.740 --> 43:41.140
sure

43:41.140 --> 43:43.220
packets can

43:43.220 --> 43:44.020
be reordered

43:44.020 --> 43:46.240
right

43:46.240 --> 43:47.580
so if a

43:47.580 --> 43:48.680
malicious router

43:48.680 --> 43:49.700
receives packets

43:49.700 --> 43:51.460
and you can

43:51.460 --> 43:51.900
say oh I

43:51.900 --> 43:52.440
received packet

43:52.440 --> 43:53.680
one before

43:53.680 --> 43:54.300
I received packet

43:54.300 --> 43:56.100
two but I'm

43:56.100 --> 43:56.520
going to send

43:56.520 --> 43:56.880
out packet

43:56.880 --> 43:59.380
two first and

43:59.380 --> 43:59.780
then packet

43:59.780 --> 44:00.500
one just to

44:00.500 --> 44:01.140
confuse and

44:01.140 --> 44:01.700
annoy people

44:01.700 --> 44:04.160
but maybe

44:04.160 --> 44:04.820
actually there's

44:04.820 --> 44:05.260
a security

44:05.260 --> 44:05.760
application

44:05.760 --> 44:06.920
if you send

44:06.920 --> 44:08.040
them the good

44:08.040 --> 44:08.780
example I tell

44:08.780 --> 44:10.340
kids in the

44:10.340 --> 44:11.160
undergrad class

44:11.160 --> 44:12.800
why reordering is

44:12.800 --> 44:13.620
important is think

44:13.620 --> 44:14.100
about this

44:14.100 --> 44:14.860
this is actually

44:14.860 --> 44:15.360
used to be the

44:15.360 --> 44:15.960
case back in

44:15.960 --> 44:17.040
the early 80s

44:17.040 --> 44:18.000
the ATM machines

44:18.000 --> 44:18.820
which used to

44:18.820 --> 44:19.720
have bank

44:19.720 --> 44:20.340
ATM machines

44:20.340 --> 44:20.880
used to have

44:20.880 --> 44:21.360
their own

44:21.360 --> 44:22.340
private network

44:22.340 --> 44:24.920
and if you

44:24.920 --> 44:26.240
and all these

44:26.240 --> 44:27.040
transactions that

44:27.040 --> 44:27.480
you do at the

44:27.480 --> 44:28.040
ATM like

44:28.040 --> 44:29.120
withdraw $100

44:29.120 --> 44:30.360
deposit $500

44:30.360 --> 44:32.480
check my balance

44:32.480 --> 44:33.280
they were like

44:33.280 --> 44:33.900
messages

44:33.900 --> 44:34.400
okay

44:34.400 --> 44:36.400
and so

44:36.400 --> 44:37.840
if you were at

44:37.840 --> 44:38.560
ATM and you

44:38.560 --> 44:39.300
said okay well

44:39.300 --> 44:40.320
here's a $500

44:40.320 --> 44:40.980
deposit

44:40.980 --> 44:43.400
and transaction

44:43.400 --> 44:44.560
click return

44:44.560 --> 44:46.440
and here's a $200

44:46.440 --> 44:47.400
withdrawal

44:47.400 --> 44:48.620
on cash

44:48.620 --> 44:50.700
well that's fine

44:50.700 --> 44:52.320
but what if you

44:52.320 --> 44:53.140
reverse the two

44:53.140 --> 44:54.700
if you reverse the

44:54.700 --> 44:54.920
two

44:54.920 --> 44:56.040
you're going to

44:56.040 --> 44:56.900
get hit with

44:56.900 --> 44:57.740
overdraft charges

44:57.740 --> 44:59.960
right

44:59.960 --> 45:01.220
if you reorder

45:01.220 --> 45:01.660
these two

45:01.660 --> 45:03.460
so that's why

45:03.460 --> 45:04.240
ordering actually

45:04.240 --> 45:05.020
matters a lot

45:05.020 --> 45:06.180
I mean not just

45:06.180 --> 45:06.740
that's a silly

45:06.740 --> 45:07.200
example

45:07.200 --> 45:07.860
of course it

45:07.860 --> 45:08.200
doesn't work

45:08.200 --> 45:08.720
today but

45:08.720 --> 45:11.140
it's an issue

45:11.140 --> 45:12.380
and it actually

45:12.380 --> 45:13.020
happens even

45:13.020 --> 45:14.140
today if you

45:14.140 --> 45:15.360
use ATM for

45:15.360 --> 45:16.560
example in a

45:16.560 --> 45:17.140
foreign country

45:17.140 --> 45:18.700
sometimes they're

45:18.700 --> 45:19.860
poorly connected

45:19.860 --> 45:21.040
and you may

45:21.040 --> 45:21.720
still like for

45:21.720 --> 45:22.120
example you

45:22.120 --> 45:22.540
deposit

45:22.540 --> 45:26.060
something in

45:26.060 --> 45:26.660
one ATM

45:26.660 --> 45:28.760
and the

45:28.760 --> 45:29.760
deposit takes

45:29.760 --> 45:30.960
a day but

45:30.960 --> 45:31.520
in the meantime

45:31.520 --> 45:32.360
you withdrew

45:32.360 --> 45:33.020
something in a

45:33.020 --> 45:33.600
different ATM

45:33.600 --> 45:34.440
that is well

45:34.440 --> 45:35.780
connected and

45:35.780 --> 45:36.120
it happens

45:36.120 --> 45:36.500
immediately

45:36.500 --> 45:38.420
you may have

45:38.420 --> 45:38.760
a problem

45:38.760 --> 45:40.140
anyway reordering

45:40.140 --> 45:40.760
is an issue

45:40.760 --> 45:42.580
deletion is an

45:42.580 --> 45:42.960
issue but

45:42.960 --> 45:43.300
there's nothing

45:43.300 --> 45:43.620
we can do

45:43.620 --> 45:44.140
about deletion

45:44.140 --> 45:44.480
right so

45:44.480 --> 45:45.200
we can delete

45:45.200 --> 45:45.860
packets right

45:45.860 --> 45:47.160
discard them

45:47.160 --> 45:47.860
on the way

45:47.860 --> 45:51.300
eavesdropping

45:51.300 --> 45:53.060
replay

45:53.060 --> 45:54.320
replaying

45:54.320 --> 45:54.940
recording

45:54.940 --> 45:55.700
all packets

45:55.700 --> 45:56.700
or recording

45:56.700 --> 45:57.160
packets

45:57.160 --> 45:58.120
in real time

45:58.120 --> 45:58.460
and then

45:58.460 --> 45:59.260
replaying them

45:59.260 --> 46:00.700
later

46:00.700 --> 46:04.900
and eavesdropping

46:04.900 --> 46:05.760
on not

46:05.760 --> 46:06.520
just data

46:06.520 --> 46:07.040
right

46:07.040 --> 46:07.420
and I want

46:07.420 --> 46:08.500
you to

46:08.500 --> 46:08.840
understand

46:08.840 --> 46:09.240
because it's

46:09.240 --> 46:09.500
important

46:09.500 --> 46:10.920
for IPsec

46:10.920 --> 46:12.600
eavesdropping

46:12.600 --> 46:13.120
on data

46:13.120 --> 46:13.420
that is

46:13.420 --> 46:13.880
carried in

46:13.880 --> 46:14.200
the packet

46:14.200 --> 46:14.640
is one

46:14.640 --> 46:14.940
thing

46:14.940 --> 46:17.380
you can

46:17.380 --> 46:17.840
protect

46:17.840 --> 46:18.120
that

46:18.120 --> 46:18.840
with like

46:18.840 --> 46:20.040
SSL

46:20.040 --> 46:20.460
TLS

46:20.460 --> 46:21.900
right

46:21.900 --> 46:23.620
but

46:23.620 --> 46:24.640
maybe

46:24.640 --> 46:25.340
maybe not

46:25.340 --> 46:25.600
right

46:25.600 --> 46:26.100
depending on

46:26.100 --> 46:26.320
what

46:26.320 --> 46:27.300
you're doing

46:27.300 --> 46:27.640
but

46:27.640 --> 46:28.960
eavesdropping

46:28.960 --> 46:29.740
on metadata

46:29.740 --> 46:30.860
cannot be

46:30.860 --> 46:31.240
protected

46:31.240 --> 46:32.300
with SSL

46:32.300 --> 46:32.680
TLS

46:32.680 --> 46:33.040
or

46:33.040 --> 46:33.640
transport

46:33.640 --> 46:33.920
layer

46:33.920 --> 46:34.400
security

46:34.400 --> 46:35.640
now

46:35.640 --> 46:35.900
what is

46:35.900 --> 46:36.200
metadata

46:36.200 --> 46:37.660
that's

46:37.660 --> 46:38.120
the data

46:38.120 --> 46:38.400
that's

46:38.400 --> 46:38.640
carried

46:38.640 --> 46:38.920
in the

46:38.920 --> 46:39.160
packet

46:39.160 --> 46:39.500
header

46:39.500 --> 46:40.660
and that

46:40.660 --> 46:40.840
be

46:40.840 --> 46:41.060
packet

46:41.060 --> 46:41.340
header

46:41.340 --> 46:42.680
and it

46:42.680 --> 46:42.920
leaks

46:42.920 --> 46:43.540
information

46:43.540 --> 46:44.860
right

46:44.860 --> 46:45.220
it leaks

46:45.220 --> 46:45.740
information

46:45.740 --> 46:46.300
among others

46:46.300 --> 46:46.740
where is

46:46.740 --> 46:47.100
this packet

46:47.100 --> 46:47.700
coming from

46:47.700 --> 46:48.620
and where

46:48.620 --> 46:49.000
is it going

46:49.000 --> 46:49.280
to

46:49.280 --> 46:50.560
that itself

46:50.560 --> 46:51.380
is sensitive

46:51.380 --> 46:51.900
information

46:51.900 --> 46:52.620
in many cases

46:52.620 --> 46:54.840
think about

46:54.840 --> 46:55.380
censorship

46:55.380 --> 46:57.180
now you ever

46:57.180 --> 46:57.820
heard of countries

46:57.820 --> 46:58.140
that do

46:58.140 --> 46:58.540
censorship

46:58.540 --> 46:59.860
right

46:59.860 --> 47:00.660
based on

47:00.660 --> 47:01.200
where packets

47:01.200 --> 47:01.680
come from

47:01.680 --> 47:02.200
going to

47:02.200 --> 47:03.620
a number

47:03.620 --> 47:04.020
of countries

47:04.020 --> 47:04.460
do that

47:04.460 --> 47:05.900
that comes

47:05.900 --> 47:06.420
from metadata

47:06.420 --> 47:10.260
so

47:10.260 --> 47:11.620
IPsec

47:11.620 --> 47:13.240
is a

47:13.240 --> 47:14.120
very very

47:14.120 --> 47:14.720
thin layer

47:14.720 --> 47:15.140
on top

47:15.140 --> 47:15.680
of IP

47:15.680 --> 47:16.840
right

47:16.840 --> 47:17.140
so it

47:17.140 --> 47:17.480
doesn't

47:17.480 --> 47:17.960
interfere

47:17.960 --> 47:18.340
of course

47:18.340 --> 47:18.600
with

47:18.600 --> 47:19.360
physical

47:19.360 --> 47:19.780
and data

47:19.780 --> 47:20.040
link

47:20.040 --> 47:20.420
layers

47:20.420 --> 47:20.820
which

47:20.820 --> 47:21.540
can use

47:21.540 --> 47:21.940
their own

47:21.940 --> 47:22.380
encryption

47:22.380 --> 47:23.180
and their

47:23.180 --> 47:23.360
own

47:23.360 --> 47:23.800
security

47:23.800 --> 47:24.460
and Wi-Fi

47:24.460 --> 47:25.080
for example

47:25.080 --> 47:26.380
uses

47:26.380 --> 47:26.940
there's a number

47:26.940 --> 47:27.420
of standards

47:27.420 --> 47:27.740
right

47:27.740 --> 47:29.020
for Wi-Fi

47:29.020 --> 47:29.500
if you dig

47:29.500 --> 47:30.280
into your

47:30.280 --> 47:31.300
laptop's Wi-Fi

47:31.300 --> 47:31.740
settings

47:31.740 --> 47:32.200
you'll see

47:32.200 --> 47:32.480
there's

47:32.480 --> 47:32.960
all kinds

47:32.960 --> 47:33.400
of options

47:33.400 --> 47:34.020
for Wi-Fi

47:34.020 --> 47:34.560
security

47:34.560 --> 47:35.900
and probably

47:35.900 --> 47:37.160
most of you

47:37.160 --> 47:37.440
have

47:37.440 --> 47:38.500
whole routers

47:38.500 --> 47:38.800
right

47:38.800 --> 47:39.420
or wireless

47:39.420 --> 47:39.800
routers

47:39.800 --> 47:40.120
that you've

47:40.120 --> 47:40.480
set up

47:40.480 --> 47:40.820
and maybe

47:40.820 --> 47:41.340
you've seen

47:41.340 --> 47:42.260
the choices

47:42.260 --> 47:43.360
different choices

47:43.360 --> 47:44.160
for Wi-Fi

47:44.160 --> 47:44.640
security

47:44.640 --> 47:44.960
right

47:44.960 --> 47:47.020
so that just

47:47.020 --> 47:47.460
protects

47:47.460 --> 47:48.880
this first

47:48.880 --> 47:49.800
last hop

47:49.800 --> 47:50.060
right

47:50.060 --> 47:50.280
this

47:50.280 --> 47:51.380
something

47:51.380 --> 47:51.860
immediate

47:51.860 --> 47:52.200
right

47:52.200 --> 47:52.900
from

47:52.900 --> 47:54.000
your device

47:54.000 --> 47:54.620
devices

47:54.620 --> 47:55.220
to the

47:55.220 --> 47:55.880
access point

47:55.880 --> 47:57.660
so that's

47:57.660 --> 47:58.040
not going

47:58.040 --> 47:58.360
to help

47:58.360 --> 47:58.700
you in the

47:58.700 --> 47:58.960
long

47:58.960 --> 47:59.280
run

47:59.280 --> 47:59.740
over

47:59.740 --> 48:00.100
the

48:00.100 --> 48:00.580
long run

48:00.580 --> 48:02.240
and so

48:02.240 --> 48:02.460
you can

48:02.460 --> 48:02.840
do this

48:02.840 --> 48:03.160
hop

48:03.160 --> 48:03.520
by hop

48:03.520 --> 48:04.060
every link

48:04.060 --> 48:04.380
can do

48:04.380 --> 48:04.720
its own

48:04.720 --> 48:05.140
encryption

48:05.140 --> 48:06.280
but it's

48:06.280 --> 48:06.540
not going

48:06.540 --> 48:06.820
to help

48:06.820 --> 48:07.360
n-to-n

48:07.360 --> 48:08.280
and so

48:08.280 --> 48:08.560
IP

48:08.560 --> 48:09.860
is the

48:09.860 --> 48:10.220
first

48:10.220 --> 48:10.660
layer

48:10.660 --> 48:11.240
in the

48:11.240 --> 48:11.640
hierarchy

48:11.640 --> 48:12.040
that is

48:12.040 --> 48:12.760
n-to-n

48:12.760 --> 48:14.620
source

48:14.620 --> 48:15.220
destination

48:15.220 --> 48:17.000
so we

48:17.000 --> 48:17.400
built

48:17.400 --> 48:18.180
here

48:18.180 --> 48:18.880
on top

48:18.880 --> 48:19.380
of network

48:19.380 --> 48:19.660
layer

48:19.660 --> 48:20.940
but it's

48:20.940 --> 48:21.340
not a

48:21.340 --> 48:21.940
transport layer

48:21.940 --> 48:22.240
it's just

48:22.240 --> 48:22.540
like a

48:22.540 --> 48:22.980
sublayer

48:22.980 --> 48:23.280
on top

48:23.280 --> 48:23.680
of network

48:23.680 --> 48:23.920
layer

48:23.920 --> 48:25.580
and its

48:25.580 --> 48:26.000
presence

48:26.000 --> 48:26.300
is

48:26.300 --> 48:26.940
transparent

48:26.940 --> 48:28.220
okay

48:28.220 --> 48:28.740
TCP

48:28.740 --> 48:29.660
UDP

48:29.660 --> 48:30.860
they don't

48:30.860 --> 48:31.100
know

48:31.100 --> 48:31.420
that it

48:31.420 --> 48:31.940
exists

48:31.940 --> 48:36.520
just a

48:36.520 --> 48:37.060
quick recap

48:37.060 --> 48:37.680
of how

48:37.680 --> 48:37.940
IP

48:37.940 --> 48:38.360
works

48:38.360 --> 48:41.020
anybody

48:41.020 --> 48:41.440
seen this

48:41.440 --> 48:41.760
before

48:41.760 --> 48:43.000
if you've

48:43.000 --> 48:43.380
taken a

48:43.380 --> 48:43.640
network

48:43.640 --> 48:43.920
course

48:43.920 --> 48:44.280
you should

48:44.280 --> 48:44.400
have

48:44.400 --> 48:44.600
seen

48:44.600 --> 48:44.920
this

48:44.920 --> 48:48.100
allowing

48:48.100 --> 48:48.500
a few

48:48.500 --> 48:48.800
of you

48:48.800 --> 48:49.100
look

48:49.100 --> 48:50.260
familiar

48:50.260 --> 48:50.580
with

48:50.580 --> 48:50.800
this

48:50.800 --> 48:52.440
okay

48:52.440 --> 48:52.720
this

48:52.720 --> 48:52.920
is

48:52.920 --> 48:53.460
the

48:53.460 --> 48:56.340
IP

48:56.340 --> 48:56.680
before

48:56.680 --> 48:56.980
heaven

48:56.980 --> 48:58.880
this

48:58.880 --> 48:59.120
is

48:59.120 --> 49:01.580
this

49:01.580 --> 49:04.780
first

49:04.780 --> 49:05.240
one

49:05.240 --> 49:05.720
two

49:05.720 --> 49:06.180
three

49:06.180 --> 49:06.580
four

49:06.580 --> 49:07.060
five

49:07.060 --> 49:07.300
the

49:07.300 --> 49:07.760
five

49:07.760 --> 49:09.040
lines

49:09.040 --> 49:09.740
are

49:09.740 --> 49:10.320
the

49:10.320 --> 49:10.520
head

49:10.520 --> 49:11.040
this

49:11.040 --> 49:11.200
is

49:11.200 --> 49:11.640
options

49:11.640 --> 49:12.380
they may

49:12.380 --> 49:12.600
or may

49:12.600 --> 49:12.880
not be

49:12.880 --> 49:13.300
present

49:13.300 --> 49:14.360
okay

49:14.360 --> 49:15.020
but the

49:15.020 --> 49:15.280
first

49:15.280 --> 49:15.660
five

49:15.660 --> 49:16.140
are always

49:16.140 --> 49:16.440
there

49:16.440 --> 49:18.720
okay

49:18.720 --> 49:19.240
and

49:19.240 --> 49:20.120
it's

49:20.120 --> 49:20.280
like

49:20.280 --> 49:20.500
this

49:20.500 --> 49:20.700
it's

49:20.700 --> 49:21.020
32

49:21.020 --> 49:21.300
bits

49:21.300 --> 49:21.480
per

49:21.480 --> 49:21.780
line

49:21.780 --> 49:25.320
so

49:25.320 --> 49:25.880
the

49:25.880 --> 49:26.080
very

49:26.080 --> 49:26.440
first

49:26.440 --> 49:26.720
thing

49:26.720 --> 49:26.880
you

49:26.880 --> 49:27.100
see

49:27.100 --> 49:27.240
in

49:27.240 --> 49:27.320
the

49:27.320 --> 49:27.540
header

49:27.540 --> 49:28.160
is

49:28.160 --> 49:28.300
a

49:28.300 --> 49:28.520
version

49:28.520 --> 49:28.880
number

49:28.880 --> 49:31.820
now

49:31.820 --> 49:33.160
do you

49:33.160 --> 49:33.340
know

49:33.340 --> 49:34.220
how many

49:34.220 --> 49:34.460
versions

49:34.460 --> 49:34.820
of IP

49:34.820 --> 49:35.160
are there

49:35.160 --> 49:43.380
that's

49:43.380 --> 49:43.540
a

49:43.540 --> 49:44.380
for one

49:44.380 --> 49:44.620
word

49:44.620 --> 49:44.920
answer

49:44.920 --> 49:45.200
you're

49:45.200 --> 49:45.420
both

49:45.420 --> 49:45.700
right

49:45.700 --> 49:45.840
and

49:45.840 --> 49:46.140
wrong

49:46.140 --> 49:48.200
which

49:48.200 --> 49:49.000
rarely

49:49.000 --> 49:49.600
happens

49:49.600 --> 49:51.480
so

49:51.480 --> 49:51.680
the

49:51.680 --> 49:51.900
six

49:51.900 --> 49:52.040
is

49:52.040 --> 49:52.160
the

49:52.160 --> 49:52.320
right

49:52.320 --> 49:52.780
answer

49:52.780 --> 49:54.300
because

49:54.300 --> 49:54.440
there

49:54.440 --> 49:54.940
exists

49:54.940 --> 49:55.280
in

49:55.280 --> 49:56.000
IPv6

49:56.000 --> 49:57.220
but

49:57.220 --> 49:57.480
there's

49:57.480 --> 49:57.760
not a

49:57.760 --> 49:58.120
conclusion

49:58.120 --> 49:58.580
there's

49:58.580 --> 49:58.760
ever

49:58.760 --> 49:58.980
been

49:58.980 --> 49:59.240
six

49:59.240 --> 49:59.500
version

49:59.500 --> 50:00.620
nobody's

50:00.620 --> 50:00.980
ever heard

50:00.980 --> 50:01.320
of one

50:01.320 --> 50:01.700
and two

50:01.700 --> 50:03.180
and I

50:03.180 --> 50:04.180
don't think

50:04.180 --> 50:04.780
even three

50:04.780 --> 50:07.300
there's

50:07.300 --> 50:08.020
IPv4

50:08.020 --> 50:09.400
and there's

50:09.400 --> 50:10.200
IPv6

50:10.200 --> 50:10.600
and

50:10.600 --> 50:12.160
IPv5

50:12.160 --> 50:12.540
is like

50:12.540 --> 50:12.840
some

50:12.840 --> 50:14.020
lost

50:14.020 --> 50:14.580
you

50:14.580 --> 50:14.600
you

50:14.600 --> 50:14.800
know

50:14.800 --> 50:15.140
I

50:15.140 --> 50:15.220
don't

50:15.220 --> 50:15.720
upward

50:15.720 --> 50:17.480
effort

50:17.480 --> 50:17.780
that

50:17.780 --> 50:17.980
never

50:17.980 --> 50:18.280
saw

50:18.280 --> 50:18.420
the

50:18.420 --> 50:18.600
light

50:18.600 --> 50:18.840
of it

50:18.840 --> 50:18.980
so

50:18.980 --> 50:19.080
I

50:19.080 --> 50:19.180
don't

50:19.180 --> 50:19.300
know

50:19.300 --> 50:19.420
what

50:19.420 --> 50:19.660
happened

50:19.660 --> 50:19.920
to

50:19.920 --> 50:20.060
the

50:20.060 --> 50:20.680
IPv5

50:20.680 --> 50:21.200
I

50:21.200 --> 50:21.400
never

50:21.400 --> 50:21.580
heard

50:21.580 --> 50:21.860
of it

50:21.860 --> 50:22.260
there

50:22.260 --> 50:22.400
is

50:22.400 --> 50:22.800
before

50:22.800 --> 50:22.960
and

50:22.960 --> 50:24.840
both

50:24.840 --> 50:25.020
of

50:25.020 --> 50:25.220
them

50:25.220 --> 50:25.980
believe it or not

50:25.980 --> 50:26.240
like

50:26.240 --> 50:27.420
TLS 1.2

50:27.420 --> 50:28.540
and TLS 1.3

50:28.540 --> 50:29.780
exist on the internet

50:29.780 --> 50:30.200
today

50:30.200 --> 50:32.240
and if

50:32.240 --> 50:32.860
you open

50:32.860 --> 50:33.600
your Mac

50:33.600 --> 50:34.120
or your

50:34.120 --> 50:34.600
Windows

50:34.600 --> 50:34.980
machine

50:34.980 --> 50:35.420
you open

50:35.420 --> 50:35.860
your network

50:35.860 --> 50:36.200
setting

50:36.200 --> 50:36.760
you will

50:36.760 --> 50:37.120
see that

50:37.120 --> 50:37.640
you probably

50:37.640 --> 50:38.140
have both

50:38.140 --> 50:38.920
an IPv6

50:38.920 --> 50:39.700
and IPv4

50:39.700 --> 50:40.040
address

50:40.040 --> 50:40.900
depending on

50:40.900 --> 50:41.300
where you

50:41.300 --> 50:41.540
are

50:41.540 --> 50:42.020
which network

50:42.020 --> 50:42.400
you're using

50:42.400 --> 50:42.640
yeah

50:42.640 --> 50:45.780
no

50:45.780 --> 50:46.480
no

50:46.480 --> 50:47.400
no

50:47.400 --> 50:47.720
because

50:47.720 --> 50:48.240
and I

50:48.240 --> 50:48.440
thought

50:48.440 --> 50:49.000
you want

50:49.000 --> 50:49.220
to know

50:49.220 --> 50:49.500
why

50:49.500 --> 50:50.620
because

50:50.620 --> 50:51.160
this is

50:51.160 --> 50:51.340
the

50:51.340 --> 50:51.720
within

50:51.720 --> 50:52.100
waste

50:52.100 --> 50:53.100
this is

50:53.100 --> 50:53.500
the only

50:53.500 --> 50:54.300
changing

50:54.300 --> 50:54.740
IP

50:54.740 --> 50:55.920
is like

50:55.920 --> 50:56.220
moving

50:56.220 --> 50:56.700
mountains

50:56.700 --> 50:58.140
okay

50:58.140 --> 50:58.620
it's a

50:58.620 --> 50:59.180
humongous

50:59.180 --> 50:59.700
undertaking

50:59.700 --> 51:00.740
people thought

51:00.740 --> 51:01.080
about it

51:01.080 --> 51:01.700
for decades

51:01.700 --> 51:02.640
because IP

51:02.640 --> 51:03.640
has fundamental

51:03.640 --> 51:04.100
issues

51:04.100 --> 51:04.480
no matter

51:04.480 --> 51:05.020
what version

51:05.020 --> 51:05.440
it is

51:05.440 --> 51:06.040
it's a fundamental

51:06.040 --> 51:06.300
issue

51:06.300 --> 51:07.380
to change

51:07.380 --> 51:07.840
to something

51:07.840 --> 51:08.280
other than

51:08.280 --> 51:08.580
IP

51:08.580 --> 51:09.420
requires

51:09.420 --> 51:10.980
incredible

51:10.980 --> 51:11.320
effort

51:11.320 --> 51:12.420
okay

51:12.420 --> 51:13.280
that's why

51:13.280 --> 51:14.240
with SSL

51:14.240 --> 51:14.620
TLS

51:14.620 --> 51:15.080
it's much

51:15.080 --> 51:15.420
easier

51:15.420 --> 51:17.040
with

51:17.040 --> 51:17.880
Kerber

51:17.880 --> 51:18.340
it's much

51:18.340 --> 51:18.560
easier

51:18.560 --> 51:19.320
this application

51:19.320 --> 51:19.820
things

51:19.820 --> 51:21.880
moving things

51:21.880 --> 51:22.360
in the network

51:22.360 --> 51:23.400
is very high

51:23.400 --> 51:24.760
moving things

51:24.760 --> 51:26.120
evolving things

51:26.120 --> 51:26.560
here

51:26.560 --> 51:28.140
easy

51:28.140 --> 51:29.580
that's

51:29.580 --> 51:29.900
hop by

51:29.900 --> 51:30.120
hop

51:30.120 --> 51:30.420
you can

51:30.420 --> 51:30.740
do it

51:30.740 --> 51:31.020
on your

51:31.020 --> 51:31.240
own

51:31.240 --> 51:31.520
in your

51:31.520 --> 51:31.820
home

51:31.820 --> 51:32.540
install

51:32.540 --> 51:32.840
some

51:32.840 --> 51:33.320
weird

51:33.320 --> 51:33.700
ass

51:33.700 --> 51:34.740
custom

51:34.740 --> 51:35.220
hack

51:35.220 --> 51:36.160
data link

51:36.160 --> 51:36.440
layer

51:36.440 --> 51:36.940
that you

51:36.940 --> 51:37.380
designed

51:37.380 --> 51:38.660
nobody cares

51:38.660 --> 51:40.220
nobody cares

51:40.220 --> 51:40.600
maybe your

51:40.600 --> 51:41.060
neighbors care

51:41.060 --> 51:42.700
but you know

51:42.700 --> 51:42.960
what I mean

51:42.960 --> 51:43.540
you're totally

51:43.540 --> 51:44.020
free to do

51:44.020 --> 51:44.240
that

51:44.240 --> 51:44.960
you want

51:44.960 --> 51:45.320
to put

51:45.320 --> 51:47.080
pigeons

51:47.080 --> 51:47.440
in the

51:47.440 --> 51:48.040
physical layer

51:48.040 --> 51:48.500
that carry

51:48.500 --> 51:49.360
IP packets

51:49.360 --> 51:49.720
you know

51:49.720 --> 51:50.880
no problem

51:50.880 --> 51:51.680
do it

51:51.680 --> 51:52.180
but

51:52.180 --> 51:52.980
yeah

51:52.980 --> 51:53.300
serious

51:53.300 --> 51:53.820
you can do

51:53.820 --> 51:54.020
it

51:54.020 --> 51:54.900
nobody cares

51:54.900 --> 51:55.600
except

51:55.600 --> 51:56.060
people

51:56.060 --> 51:57.240
get pooped

51:57.240 --> 51:57.420
on

51:57.420 --> 51:57.960
but

51:57.960 --> 51:59.240
network

51:59.240 --> 51:59.520
layer

51:59.520 --> 52:00.120
is where

52:00.120 --> 52:00.500
it's

52:00.500 --> 52:00.880
common

52:00.880 --> 52:01.240
and so

52:01.240 --> 52:01.640
it's

52:01.640 --> 52:02.080
impossible

52:02.080 --> 52:04.860
let me put it

52:04.860 --> 52:05.180
this way

52:05.180 --> 52:05.840
you all

52:05.840 --> 52:06.360
got a lot

52:06.360 --> 52:06.680
of years

52:06.680 --> 52:06.920
ahead

52:06.920 --> 52:07.980
I would

52:07.980 --> 52:08.580
be super

52:08.580 --> 52:08.960
duper

52:08.960 --> 52:09.560
surprised

52:09.560 --> 52:10.600
if there's

52:10.600 --> 52:11.400
IPV7

52:11.400 --> 52:12.020
or anything

52:12.020 --> 52:12.700
higher than

52:12.700 --> 52:13.000
6

52:13.000 --> 52:13.880
in your

52:13.880 --> 52:14.340
lifetime

52:14.340 --> 52:15.900
of course

52:15.900 --> 52:16.340
never say

52:16.340 --> 52:16.540
no

52:16.540 --> 52:16.820
never

52:16.820 --> 52:17.100
but

52:17.100 --> 52:17.760
I would

52:17.760 --> 52:18.600
be really

52:18.600 --> 52:19.020
surprised

52:19.020 --> 52:19.500
because

52:19.500 --> 52:19.700
it's

52:19.700 --> 52:20.060
such a

52:20.060 --> 52:20.260
hard

52:20.260 --> 52:20.460
thing

52:20.460 --> 52:25.620
yeah

52:25.620 --> 52:26.160
but let's

52:26.160 --> 52:27.500
keep our

52:27.500 --> 52:27.820
eye on the

52:27.820 --> 52:28.020
ball

52:28.020 --> 52:28.360
what

52:28.360 --> 52:28.920
IP

52:28.920 --> 52:29.280
before

52:29.280 --> 52:29.640
remember

52:29.640 --> 52:30.120
designed

52:30.120 --> 52:30.500
in like

52:30.500 --> 52:30.760
early

52:30.760 --> 52:32.360
80s

52:32.360 --> 52:32.600
they

52:32.600 --> 52:32.820
thought

52:32.820 --> 52:33.320
jeez

52:33.320 --> 52:34.000
we have

52:34.000 --> 52:35.140
5,000

52:35.140 --> 52:35.840
10,000

52:35.840 --> 52:36.320
hosts

52:36.320 --> 52:36.620
on the

52:36.620 --> 52:37.060
internet

52:37.060 --> 52:38.580
32 bits

52:38.580 --> 52:39.780
is enough

52:39.780 --> 52:40.480
for an

52:40.480 --> 52:40.880
address

52:40.880 --> 52:43.520
32 bits

52:43.520 --> 52:43.980
2 to the

52:43.980 --> 52:44.320
32

52:44.320 --> 52:44.820
right

52:44.820 --> 52:45.660
big number

52:45.660 --> 52:47.860
wrong

52:47.860 --> 52:48.980
not such a

52:48.980 --> 52:49.340
big number

52:49.340 --> 52:49.800
after all

52:49.800 --> 52:51.180
so

52:51.180 --> 52:51.540
already

52:51.540 --> 52:52.360
by the

52:52.360 --> 52:53.120
decade

52:53.120 --> 52:53.520
later

52:53.520 --> 52:53.740
like

52:53.740 --> 52:54.000
maybe

52:54.000 --> 52:54.300
like

52:54.300 --> 52:54.820
late

52:54.820 --> 52:56.020
80s

52:56.020 --> 52:56.140
they

52:56.140 --> 52:56.320
started

52:56.320 --> 52:56.500
saying

52:56.500 --> 52:57.020
ah

52:57.020 --> 52:57.340
maybe

52:57.340 --> 52:57.580
mid

52:57.580 --> 52:57.840
80s

52:57.840 --> 52:58.000
even

52:58.000 --> 52:58.680
we're

52:58.680 --> 52:58.880
going to

52:58.880 --> 52:59.080
run

52:59.080 --> 52:59.400
out

52:59.400 --> 53:00.380
sooner

53:00.380 --> 53:00.580
or

53:00.580 --> 53:00.820
later

the

53:06.200 --> 53:06.360
is

53:06.360 --> 53:06.640
actually

53:06.640 --> 53:06.980
they never

53:06.980 --> 53:07.340
did

53:07.340 --> 53:08.700
and

53:08.700 --> 53:08.980
we still

53:08.980 --> 53:09.160
use

53:09.680 --> 53:09.860
means

53:09.860 --> 53:10.020
we

53:10.020 --> 53:10.220
didn't

53:10.220 --> 53:10.480
quite

53:10.780 --> 53:11.380

53:11.880 --> 53:12.160
is

53:12.160 --> 53:12.440

53:12.440 --> 53:13.740
and

53:13.740 --> 53:13.920
this

53:13.920 --> 53:14.060
is

53:14.060 --> 53:14.380
totally

53:14.380 --> 53:14.800

53:14.800 --> 53:15.420

the

53:22.660 --> 53:22.780
of

53:22.780 --> 53:23.000
this

53:23.000 --> 53:23.840
weird

53:23.840 --> 53:24.320

53:25.120 --> 53:26.540
they

53:26.540 --> 53:27.280

huge

53:30.060 --> 53:30.240
never

used

53:30.500 --> 53:30.720
them

53:30.720 --> 53:32.300

53:32.300 --> 53:32.940
they

53:32.940 --> 53:33.220
also

53:33.220 --> 53:33.720

so

53:35.640 --> 53:35.820
in

53:35.820 --> 53:35.940
the

53:35.940 --> 53:36.100

53:36.100 --> 53:36.260
I

53:36.260 --> 53:36.480
think

53:36.480 --> 53:36.720
they

53:36.720 --> 53:37.120
released

53:37.120 --> 53:37.560
some

them

53:37.880 --> 53:38.340
gradually

53:38.340 --> 53:38.720
so

53:38.720 --> 53:39.200
we

53:39.200 --> 53:39.400
wound

53:39.400 --> 53:39.520

53:39.520 --> 53:39.760
never

53:39.760 --> 53:40.180
not

53:40.180 --> 53:40.540

53:42.240 --> 53:43.240
but

53:43.240 --> 53:43.700
it's

53:43.700 --> 53:43.980
still

53:43.980 --> 53:44.940
not

53:44.940 --> 53:45.060
a

53:45.060 --> 53:45.200
good

53:45.200 --> 53:45.600
idea

53:45.600 --> 53:46.100
to

53:46.100 --> 53:46.340

the

so

53:48.820 --> 53:49.460

53:49.460 --> 53:49.660
was

53:49.660 --> 53:50.080

54:16.700 --> 54:17.460
now

it just

55:17.160 --> 55:17.620
is out

55:17.620 --> 55:20.200
is it

55:20.200 --> 55:21.860
because

55:21.860 --> 55:22.660
it was

55:22.660 --> 55:22.860
like

55:22.860 --> 55:23.200
very

55:23.200 --> 55:24.740
old

55:24.740 --> 55:25.500
that

55:25.500 --> 55:26.280
it

55:26.280 --> 55:26.560
seems

55:26.560 --> 55:26.860
like

55:26.860 --> 55:27.520
odd

55:27.520 --> 55:27.860
that

55:27.860 --> 55:28.900
they

55:28.900 --> 55:29.040
would

55:29.040 --> 55:29.300
waste

55:29.300 --> 55:29.480
so

55:29.480 --> 55:29.640
many

55:29.640 --> 55:30.060
bits

55:30.060 --> 55:31.240
to

55:31.240 --> 55:31.400
say

55:31.400 --> 55:31.740
five

55:31.740 --> 55:31.980
rather

55:31.980 --> 55:32.100
than

55:32.100 --> 55:32.640
oh

55:32.640 --> 55:32.800
no

55:32.800 --> 55:32.980
no

55:32.980 --> 55:33.180
it's

55:33.180 --> 55:33.320
not

55:33.320 --> 55:33.600
always

55:33.600 --> 55:33.900
five

55:33.900 --> 55:34.840
it's

55:34.840 --> 55:35.000
not

55:35.000 --> 55:35.180
always

55:35.180 --> 55:35.460
it could

55:35.460 --> 55:35.580
be

55:35.580 --> 55:35.980
longer

55:35.980 --> 55:36.300
it could

55:36.300 --> 55:36.420
be

55:36.420 --> 55:36.700
longer

55:36.700 --> 55:36.980
because

55:36.980 --> 55:37.140
of

55:37.140 --> 55:37.640
options

55:37.640 --> 55:39.340
it

55:39.340 --> 55:39.780
has

55:39.780 --> 55:39.900
to

55:39.900 --> 55:40.000
be

55:40.000 --> 55:40.140
at

55:40.140 --> 55:40.340
least

55:40.340 --> 55:40.640
five

55:40.640 --> 55:40.880
right

55:40.880 --> 55:41.180
so

55:41.180 --> 55:41.420
it

55:41.420 --> 55:41.620
has

55:41.620 --> 55:41.740
to

55:41.740 --> 55:42.020
be

55:42.020 --> 55:42.480
it

55:42.480 --> 55:42.720
has

55:42.720 --> 55:42.840
to

55:42.840 --> 55:43.020
be

55:43.020 --> 55:43.260
that's

55:43.260 --> 55:43.480
right

55:43.480 --> 55:43.640
I

55:43.640 --> 55:44.200
well

55:44.200 --> 55:44.480
wait

55:44.480 --> 55:44.760
a minute

55:44.760 --> 55:45.040
I

55:45.040 --> 55:45.600
don't

55:45.600 --> 55:45.820
quote

55:45.820 --> 55:45.980
me

55:45.980 --> 55:47.480
I used

55:47.480 --> 55:47.600
to

55:47.600 --> 55:47.760
know

55:47.760 --> 55:47.960
this

55:47.960 --> 55:48.200
I

55:48.200 --> 55:48.380
should

55:48.380 --> 55:48.540
look

55:48.540 --> 55:48.780
back

55:48.780 --> 55:49.160
it

55:49.160 --> 55:49.380
may

55:49.380 --> 55:49.540
be

55:49.540 --> 55:49.780
that

55:49.780 --> 55:50.440
five

55:50.440 --> 55:50.620
is

55:50.620 --> 55:50.760
the

55:50.760 --> 55:51.020
minimum

55:51.020 --> 55:51.240
so

55:51.240 --> 55:51.360
it

55:51.360 --> 55:51.640
counts

55:51.640 --> 55:51.920
over

55:51.920 --> 55:52.400
five

55:52.400 --> 55:53.300
but

55:53.300 --> 55:53.980
it

55:53.980 --> 55:54.180
has

55:54.180 --> 55:54.300
to

55:54.300 --> 55:54.540
have

55:54.540 --> 55:54.700
the

55:54.700 --> 55:54.980
length

55:54.980 --> 55:56.420
and

55:56.420 --> 55:56.820
I'm

55:56.820 --> 55:57.060
pretty

55:57.060 --> 55:57.380
sure

55:57.380 --> 55:57.720
that

55:57.720 --> 55:58.300
let's

55:58.300 --> 55:58.520
see

55:58.520 --> 55:58.840
one

55:58.840 --> 55:59.180
two

55:59.180 --> 55:59.820
four

55:59.820 --> 56:00.160
the

56:00.160 --> 56:04.340
other

56:04.340 --> 56:04.680
question

56:04.680 --> 56:04.860
is

56:04.860 --> 56:05.000
why

56:05.000 --> 56:05.200
would

56:05.200 --> 56:05.380
you need

56:05.380 --> 56:05.520
the

56:05.520 --> 56:05.880
IHL

56:05.880 --> 56:06.060
if you

56:06.060 --> 56:06.160
have

56:06.160 --> 56:06.280
the

56:06.280 --> 56:06.420
total

56:06.420 --> 56:06.640
length

56:06.640 --> 56:06.900
anyway

56:06.900 --> 56:09.260
why

56:09.260 --> 56:09.540
do

56:09.540 --> 56:09.760
you

56:09.760 --> 56:10.020
need

56:10.020 --> 56:10.260
to

56:10.260 --> 56:10.700
ah

56:10.700 --> 56:11.100
total

56:11.100 --> 56:11.540
length

56:11.540 --> 56:11.960
is

56:11.960 --> 56:12.680
including

56:12.680 --> 56:12.900
the

56:12.900 --> 56:13.200
data

56:13.200 --> 56:15.700
that

56:15.700 --> 56:16.260
includes

56:16.260 --> 56:16.860
the

56:16.860 --> 56:17.080
data

56:17.080 --> 56:17.280
that

56:17.480 --> 56:17.760
I'll show

56:17.760 --> 56:17.980
you

56:17.980 --> 56:18.800
okay

56:18.800 --> 56:19.280
below

56:19.280 --> 56:19.740
this

56:19.740 --> 56:20.440
that's

56:20.440 --> 56:20.540
the

56:20.540 --> 56:20.700
header

56:20.700 --> 56:20.960
below

56:20.960 --> 56:21.240
this

56:21.240 --> 56:21.380
is

56:21.380 --> 56:21.500
the

56:21.500 --> 56:21.740
data

56:21.740 --> 56:23.260
so

56:23.260 --> 56:23.600
that's

56:23.600 --> 56:23.960
a

56:23.960 --> 56:24.160
different

56:24.160 --> 56:24.400
bit

56:24.400 --> 56:24.740
and

56:24.740 --> 56:25.080
that's

56:25.080 --> 56:25.440
16

56:25.440 --> 56:25.760
bits

56:25.760 --> 56:26.240
so

56:26.240 --> 56:26.800
the

56:26.800 --> 56:27.220
maximum

56:27.220 --> 56:27.540
you could

56:27.540 --> 56:27.760
ever

56:27.760 --> 56:28.140
transmit

56:28.140 --> 56:28.520
in one

56:28.520 --> 56:28.840
packet

56:28.840 --> 56:29.060
is

56:29.060 --> 56:29.280
2 to

56:29.280 --> 56:29.360
the

56:29.360 --> 56:29.640
16

56:29.640 --> 56:30.260
IP

56:30.260 --> 56:30.500
does

56:30.500 --> 56:30.760
not

56:30.760 --> 56:31.020
tell

56:31.020 --> 56:31.380
you

56:31.380 --> 56:33.500
how

56:33.500 --> 56:33.900
big

56:33.900 --> 56:34.180
a

56:34.180 --> 56:34.480
packet

56:34.480 --> 56:34.880
can

56:34.880 --> 56:35.180
be

56:35.180 --> 56:36.320
up to

56:36.320 --> 56:36.560
that

56:36.560 --> 56:37.240
cannot

56:37.240 --> 56:37.400
be

56:37.400 --> 56:37.600
built

56:37.600 --> 56:38.020
above

56:38.020 --> 56:38.540
you

56:38.540 --> 56:38.680
know

56:38.680 --> 56:38.840
2

56:38.840 --> 56:38.860
to

56:38.860 --> 56:39.180
the

56:39.180 --> 56:41.320
16

56:41.320 --> 56:43.780
minus

56:43.780 --> 56:44.100
1

56:44.100 --> 56:45.780
but

56:45.780 --> 56:46.340
it

56:46.340 --> 56:46.460
can

56:46.460 --> 56:46.620
be

56:46.620 --> 56:47.160
less

56:47.160 --> 56:47.680
and

56:47.680 --> 56:48.080
that's

56:48.080 --> 56:48.540
determined

56:48.540 --> 56:49.020
by

56:49.020 --> 56:49.700
that's

56:49.700 --> 56:49.900
again

56:49.900 --> 56:50.160
more

56:50.160 --> 56:50.300
than

56:50.300 --> 56:50.400
you

56:50.400 --> 56:50.520
want

56:50.520 --> 56:50.600
to

56:50.600 --> 56:50.780
know

56:50.780 --> 56:51.000
but

56:51.000 --> 56:51.200
is

56:51.200 --> 56:51.660
determined

56:51.660 --> 56:51.980
by

56:51.980 --> 56:52.260
the

56:52.260 --> 56:52.760

56:54.060 --> 56:54.580

56:54.580 --> 56:55.060

56:55.620 --> 56:56.380
of

the

56:57.840 --> 56:58.260

the

56:58.700 --> 56:59.160
the

56:59.160 --> 56:59.440

56:59.440 --> 56:59.780
that you're

56:59.780 --> 57:00.120
transmitting

57:00.120 --> 57:00.340
it

57:00.340 --> 57:01.060
so

57:01.060 --> 57:01.220
for

57:01.220 --> 57:01.480
example

57:01.480 --> 57:01.720
for

57:01.720 --> 57:01.900
an

57:01.900 --> 57:02.240
internet

57:02.240 --> 57:02.500
it's

57:02.500 --> 57:03.080
1,500

57:03.080 --> 57:03.620
something

57:03.620 --> 57:04.660
bytes

57:04.660 --> 57:06.080
okay

57:06.080 --> 57:06.400
there are

57:06.400 --> 57:06.540
some

57:06.540 --> 57:06.900
other

57:06.900 --> 57:08.260

57:08.260 --> 57:08.700
where it's

57:08.700 --> 57:09.060
smaller

57:09.060 --> 57:09.460
and some

57:09.460 --> 57:09.780

57:09.780 --> 57:10.180
bigger

57:10.180 --> 57:11.640
identification

57:11.640 --> 57:12.600
is essentially

57:12.600 --> 57:12.960
like a

57:12.960 --> 57:13.560

57:13.560 --> 57:13.800
of the

57:13.800 --> 57:14.060

57:14.060 --> 57:15.780
it

57:15.780 --> 57:16.180
allows

57:16.180 --> 57:16.460
the

57:17.620 --> 57:18.100
to say

57:18.100 --> 57:18.420
okay

57:18.420 --> 57:19.160
to order

called

57:27.540 --> 57:28.220

57:28.220 --> 57:28.800
which

57:28.800 --> 57:29.020
means

57:29.020 --> 57:29.180
if

57:29.180 --> 57:29.300
you

57:29.300 --> 57:29.660
give

57:33.840 --> 57:35.320
it

57:35.320 --> 57:35.500
will

57:41.220 --> 57:41.400
its

57:41.400 --> 57:41.640

57:41.640 --> 57:42.720
am I

57:42.720 --> 57:43.500
making

57:43.500 --> 57:43.840
sense

57:43.840 --> 57:44.880
so

57:44.880 --> 57:45.080
if

57:45.080 --> 57:45.240
the

57:45.240 --> 57:46.020

57:46.020 --> 57:46.520
transmission

57:46.520 --> 57:46.920
unit

57:46.920 --> 57:47.340
on its

next

57:48.340 --> 57:48.800
top

57:48.800 --> 57:49.220
is

57:49.220 --> 57:49.660
1500

57:49.660 --> 57:50.320
bytes

57:50.320 --> 57:50.860
it

57:50.860 --> 57:51.040
will

57:51.040 --> 57:51.380
chop

57:51.380 --> 57:52.100
everything

57:52.100 --> 57:52.360
into

57:52.360 --> 57:52.600
that

57:52.600 --> 57:53.220
appropriate

57:53.220 --> 57:53.760
size

57:53.760 --> 57:54.260
and

57:54.260 --> 57:54.480
then

57:54.480 --> 57:54.640
it

57:54.640 --> 57:54.840
needs

57:54.840 --> 57:55.000
to

57:55.000 --> 57:55.600
reassemble

57:55.600 --> 57:55.900
them

57:55.900 --> 57:56.060
at

57:56.060 --> 57:56.180
the

57:56.180 --> 57:56.760
receiver

57:56.760 --> 57:57.100
which

57:57.100 --> 57:57.220
is

57:57.220 --> 57:57.420
a

57:57.420 --> 57:57.880
huge

57:57.880 --> 57:58.160
pain

57:58.160 --> 57:58.280
in

57:58.280 --> 57:58.700
ass

57:58.700 --> 58:00.020
because

58:00.020 --> 58:00.620
fragments

58:00.620 --> 58:01.760
of

58:01.760 --> 58:01.900
the

same

58:02.160 --> 58:02.540

58:02.540 --> 58:03.940
can

58:03.940 --> 58:04.160
also

58:04.160 --> 58:04.380
be

58:04.380 --> 58:04.780
fragmented

58:04.780 --> 58:05.000
in

58:05.000 --> 58:05.400
transit

58:05.400 --> 58:08.300
they

58:08.300 --> 58:08.480
can

58:08.480 --> 58:08.640
never

58:08.640 --> 58:08.820
be

58:08.820 --> 58:09.340
reassembled

58:09.340 --> 58:09.500
in

58:09.500 --> 58:09.780
transit

58:09.780 --> 58:10.320
because

58:10.320 --> 58:10.720
in

58:10.720 --> 58:11.020
transit

58:11.020 --> 58:11.380
everything

58:11.380 --> 58:11.620
is

58:11.620 --> 58:11.820
treated

58:11.820 --> 58:12.460
as

58:12.460 --> 58:12.620
one

58:12.620 --> 58:12.920
packet

58:12.920 --> 58:14.280
but

58:14.280 --> 58:14.540
when

58:14.540 --> 58:14.740
they

58:14.740 --> 58:15.080
arrive

58:15.080 --> 58:15.220
at

58:15.220 --> 58:15.320
the

58:15.320 --> 58:15.860
destination

58:15.860 --> 58:16.360
they

58:16.360 --> 58:16.540
need

58:16.540 --> 58:16.660
to

58:16.660 --> 58:16.800
be

58:16.800 --> 58:17.380
reassembled

58:17.380 --> 58:17.620
and

58:17.620 --> 58:17.940
IP

58:17.940 --> 58:18.480
before

58:18.480 --> 58:19.800
implementations

58:19.800 --> 58:20.420
suck

58:20.420 --> 58:20.740
because

58:20.740 --> 58:20.940
of

58:20.940 --> 58:21.120
this

58:21.120 --> 58:21.500
they

58:21.500 --> 58:21.620
are

58:21.620 --> 58:22.160
complex

58:22.160 --> 58:22.700
because

58:22.700 --> 58:23.160
fragmentation

58:23.160 --> 58:23.640
is a

58:23.640 --> 58:23.840
very

58:23.840 --> 58:24.240
painful

58:24.240 --> 58:24.600
thing

58:24.600 --> 58:25.700
also

58:25.700 --> 58:25.900
for

58:25.900 --> 58:26.320
security

58:26.320 --> 58:27.260
IP

58:27.260 --> 58:27.720
6

58:27.720 --> 58:28.600
has

58:28.600 --> 58:28.840
no

58:28.840 --> 58:29.280
fragmentation

58:29.280 --> 58:32.360
so

58:32.360 --> 58:33.000
fragmentation

58:33.000 --> 58:33.340
offset

58:33.340 --> 58:33.660
means

58:33.660 --> 58:34.320
how far

58:34.320 --> 58:34.560
into

58:34.560 --> 58:34.760
the

58:34.760 --> 58:35.140
original

58:35.140 --> 58:35.500
packet

58:35.500 --> 58:35.800
is

58:35.800 --> 58:36.100
this

58:36.100 --> 58:36.720
particular

58:36.720 --> 58:37.060
packet

58:37.060 --> 58:39.200
make sense

58:39.200 --> 58:39.780
yeah

58:39.780 --> 58:41.340
like

58:41.340 --> 58:41.680
where

58:41.680 --> 58:42.480
in the

58:42.480 --> 58:42.740
original

58:42.740 --> 58:43.040
packet

58:43.040 --> 58:43.280
does

58:43.280 --> 58:43.520
this

58:43.520 --> 58:43.720
one

58:43.720 --> 58:44.120
start

58:44.120 --> 58:45.300
which

58:45.300 --> 58:45.580
piece

58:45.580 --> 58:45.720
of

58:45.720 --> 58:45.860
the

58:45.860 --> 58:46.100
puzzle

58:46.100 --> 58:46.340
is

58:46.340 --> 58:46.660
this

58:46.660 --> 58:49.200
time

58:49.200 --> 58:49.560
to live

58:49.560 --> 58:49.780
is a

58:49.780 --> 58:49.980
hot

58:49.980 --> 58:50.340
count

58:50.340 --> 58:51.420
usually

58:51.420 --> 58:52.360
initialized

58:52.360 --> 58:53.460
to 255

58:53.460 --> 58:54.160
not always

58:54.160 --> 58:54.960
but up

58:54.960 --> 58:55.820
to 255

58:55.820 --> 58:56.180
that's the

58:56.180 --> 58:56.340
only

58:56.340 --> 58:57.040
thing

58:57.040 --> 58:57.280
you can

58:57.280 --> 58:57.760
put there

58:57.760 --> 58:58.940
and the

58:58.940 --> 58:59.220
maximum

58:59.220 --> 58:59.640
value

58:59.640 --> 59:00.260
and it's

59:00.260 --> 59:00.820
decremented

59:00.820 --> 59:01.620
by every

59:01.620 --> 59:02.000
router

59:02.000 --> 59:02.320
that

59:02.320 --> 59:02.800
sees

59:02.800 --> 59:02.980
the

59:02.980 --> 59:03.240
packet

59:03.240 --> 59:04.440
the

59:04.440 --> 59:04.640
reason

59:04.640 --> 59:04.880
it's

59:04.880 --> 59:05.080
there

59:05.080 --> 59:05.340
is to

59:05.340 --> 59:05.700
avoid

59:05.700 --> 59:06.320
loops

59:06.320 --> 59:07.100
routing

59:07.100 --> 59:07.400
loops

59:07.400 --> 59:07.820
and all kinds

59:07.820 --> 59:08.180
of weird

59:08.180 --> 59:08.600
traffic

59:08.600 --> 59:09.200
things that

59:09.200 --> 59:09.460
used to

59:09.460 --> 59:09.700
happen

59:09.700 --> 59:09.940
on the

59:09.940 --> 59:10.200
internet

59:10.200 --> 59:11.720
right

59:11.720 --> 59:11.980
if you

59:11.980 --> 59:12.160
don't

59:12.160 --> 59:12.540
have it

59:12.540 --> 59:12.820
then

59:12.820 --> 59:14.260
in theory

59:14.260 --> 59:15.100
a packet

59:15.100 --> 59:15.340
can

59:15.340 --> 59:16.020
forever

59:16.020 --> 59:16.260
run

59:16.260 --> 59:16.600
around

59:16.600 --> 59:17.860
like in

59:17.860 --> 59:18.280
a maze

59:18.280 --> 59:20.040
so

59:20.040 --> 59:20.420
once it

59:20.420 --> 59:20.660
reaches

59:20.660 --> 59:21.080
zero

59:21.080 --> 59:22.500
the router

59:22.500 --> 59:23.060
that receives

59:23.060 --> 59:23.260
it

59:23.260 --> 59:23.880
and decrements

59:23.880 --> 59:24.100
it to

59:24.100 --> 59:24.380
zero

59:24.380 --> 59:25.240
discards

59:25.240 --> 59:25.640
the packet

59:25.640 --> 59:33.180
also because

59:33.180 --> 59:33.800
that consumes

59:33.800 --> 59:34.340
resources

59:34.340 --> 59:34.740
right

59:34.740 --> 59:35.880
protocol

59:35.880 --> 59:37.180
protocol means

59:37.180 --> 59:37.720
not IP

59:37.720 --> 59:38.700
what is the

59:38.700 --> 59:39.360
next protocol

59:39.360 --> 59:40.960
which transport

59:40.960 --> 59:41.180
layer

59:41.180 --> 59:41.520
which

59:41.520 --> 59:41.920
which

59:41.920 --> 59:43.500
which protocol

59:43.500 --> 59:43.980
is going to

59:43.980 --> 59:44.560
handle this

59:44.560 --> 59:45.320
packet after

59:45.320 --> 59:45.680
IP

59:45.680 --> 59:46.520
when it

59:46.520 --> 59:47.960
goes up

59:47.960 --> 59:49.360
remember

59:49.360 --> 59:50.240
packet is

59:50.240 --> 59:50.740
received at

59:50.740 --> 59:51.360
the destination

59:51.360 --> 59:53.040
goes for the

59:53.040 --> 59:53.780
physical layer

59:53.780 --> 59:54.040
right

59:54.040 --> 59:54.260
then

59:54.260 --> 59:55.220
from physical

59:55.220 --> 59:55.440
layer

59:55.440 --> 59:55.700
to the

59:55.700 --> 59:56.060
data link

59:56.060 --> 59:56.240
layer

59:56.240 --> 59:56.680
I hand it

59:56.680 --> 59:57.060
over to

59:57.060 --> 59:57.360
IP

59:57.360 --> 59:57.700
IP

59:57.700 --> 59:58.200
does its

59:58.200 --> 59:58.460
thing

59:58.460 --> 59:58.820
and says

59:58.820 --> 59:59.260
what do I

59:59.260 --> 59:59.480
do with

59:59.480 --> 59:59.840
it next

59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.760
protocol

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.360
tells it

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.800
okay

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.600
it invokes

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.320
the appropriate

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:04.800
function

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.820
if it's a

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:06.480
TCP packet

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:06.860
it calls

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.220
TCP

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:07.640
received

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.140
if it's a

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:08.840
UDPAC packet

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.180
it calls

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:09.500
UDP

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:09.900
received

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:10.600
etc

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.540
header

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.120
checksum

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.080
header

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.600
checksum

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.360
is a very

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.020
very silly

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:15.680
value

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.700
it's a

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.740
once complement

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.160
of once

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:18.600
complement

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.380
of XOR

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.120
of all

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.520
the 16

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.720

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:24.340

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:24.620
like

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.160
fold it

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:25.360
here

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.080
it's a

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:26.340
terrible

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:26.760
it's a

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:27.080

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.200
basically

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.840
it catches

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.720
benign errors

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.740
like if

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:34.920
routers used

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.340
to be very

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:35.980
unreliable

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.340
and once

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:36.600
another

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.120
flip a

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:37.320
bit

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.700
well if

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.040
you flip

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:39.340
a bit

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:39.600
in the

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:39.840
header

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.300
you know

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:40.660
you can

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:40.900
like

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:41.500
change

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:41.640
the

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.140
destination

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:42.460
of the

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:42.680
source

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.340
so

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:43.860
the reason

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:44.340
checksum

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:44.640
is there

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:44.920
is to

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:45.160
catch

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:45.400
such

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:45.760
errors

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:45.920
in

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.340
routers

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:46.800
and

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:47.020
throw

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:47.160
away

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:47.280
the

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:47.480
pattern

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.200
but it's

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:49.460
not

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:49.800
supposed

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:49.980
to

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:50.360
protect

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:50.740
against

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.800
attack

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.480
at all

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.180
okay

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.560

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:56.960

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.060

01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:58.880
yay

01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.440
okay

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.020
that was

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.500
a 32

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.160

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.480

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.300
have you ever

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:16.000
ping

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:16.940
you're

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:17.160
using

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:17.380
what's

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.020
it

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:20.640

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:22.440
it

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:22.620

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:26.180
timing

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:26.360
so

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.080
you use

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:27.280
what's

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:27.400

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:29.840

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.480
the second

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:30.720

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.100
the third

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:34.460
route

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:34.680
is

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:34.860
used

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:35.400

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.100

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:36.420
which

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:36.640
tells

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:36.800
you

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.540
exact

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.000
route

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.620
that

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.000
the packet

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:39.380
takes

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:39.720
as it

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:39.940
gets

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:40.060
to

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:40.600
destination

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.900
so

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:42.180
every

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:42.480
router

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:47.680
okay

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.020
most packets

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.680
normal packets

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.040
don't have

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:51.340
options

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.500
everything you

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:53.980
see in red

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:54.480
this should be

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.080
red

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:55.760
not blue

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.660
everything you

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:57.220
see in red

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:58.060
changes

01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.040
hop by hop

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.800
or at least

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.600
can't change

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.340
time to live

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.060
always changes

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.200
for every hop

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.540
fragment offset

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.420
can change

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:13.000
if a router

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.700
refragments

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:14.140
the packet

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.160
for example

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:15.500
if you see

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:15.860
the packet

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:16.380
of 1500

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:17.100
bytes

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:17.620
and the

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:18.080
next hop

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:18.560
only takes

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.320
800 bytes

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:19.800
maximum

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.520
so you

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:20.740
have to

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.280
split that

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:21.620
in two

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.940
and that

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:23.300
changes

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:23.720
the header

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.100
checksum

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:24.480
will change

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:24.720
too

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.220
in fact

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:25.460
the header

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:25.780
checksum

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:26.100
changes

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:26.640
anytime

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.000
anyway

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:27.300
because

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:27.800
time to live

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:28.180
changes

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:28.840
yeah

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.960
absolutely

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.360
absolutely

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.240
it should

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:36.600
change

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.120
but I think

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.240
IHL is not

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:38.820
including the

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:39.140
options

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.640
I think

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.220
it is

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:42.820
I think

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:43.120
it's back

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:43.400
to his

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:43.680
question

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.100
why is it

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:44.440
five

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.020
I think

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:45.240
it is

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:45.460
just

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:45.800
waste

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.240
but I

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:47.460
double

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:47.760
check

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.420
my memory

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:50.100
is just

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:50.360
like

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.800
why

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.220
yeah

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:53.880
I looked

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.120
it up

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:54.900
it has

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:55.220
to be

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:55.580
like the

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:55.820
minimum

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:56.240
value

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:56.500
is

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.000
five

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.940
and the

01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.160
max

01:02:59.160 --> 01:02:59.760
is 15

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.360
max

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:00.960
is 15

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.480
but

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.700
I think

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.240
he's right

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:04.760
because if

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.340
you record

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:05.840
the route

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.300
it will go

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:07.920
over 15

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.840
so I have to

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.240
look up the

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:09.760
answer to that

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.080
question

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:10.600
what happens

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:10.980
I think

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.000
I think

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:11.620
I think

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:11.900
it should

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.200
not

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:12.440
but

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.120
don't know

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.300
anyway

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:15.660
so

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.440
one of the

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:17.760
things I

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.260
point out

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:18.720
is these

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.760
red fields

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.100
they can

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:20.500
change

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.260
in transit

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.080
okay

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:23.460
the other

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:23.960
fields must

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:24.600
be the same

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.440
IPv6

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.140
in contrast

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.340
very different

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:31.940
but notice

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:32.540
the version number

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:32.800
right

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.780
that's the

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.380
common language

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:34.840
they have

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.820
see the version

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.040
number

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:36.360
in the very

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:36.660
corner

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.920
same

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.620
same field

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:39.020
same

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:39.640
same length

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.500
this is how

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:40.780
you know

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:41.580
oh IPv6

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:42.340
IPv4

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:42.760
yeah

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.900
when you say

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:44.520
you can't

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:44.820
change the

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.040
route

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:45.960
are you

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.480
including

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:46.820
like

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:47.540
adding

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:48.680
routers

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.000
because that

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:49.300
would change

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:49.820
the source

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:50.920
or destination

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.240
shouldn't

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:53.480
right

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.140
because IPv

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:54.460
was designed

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:55.020
before NAT

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:55.640
yeah

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.580
yes

01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.020
of course

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:57.460
NATs are

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:57.860
an exception

01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.320
I mean

01:03:59.320 --> 01:03:59.600
you could

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.280
always do

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:00.700
things that

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:00.940
you're not

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:01.460
supposed to

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:01.660
right

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.040
in a way

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.120
but NAT

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:03.660
was originally

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:04.160
a hack

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.320
that people

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:05.720
frowned

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.000
upon

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.280
now

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:06.620
it's a

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:06.880
standard

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.220
2

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:07.680
so it

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.300
co-exists

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.100
yeah

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.140
okay

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:11.720
so now

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.560
notice

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.380
no options

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.040
anymore

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.120
notice

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:15.820
no fragments

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:16.240
anymore

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.340
much cleaner

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:18.900
design

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.540
destination

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:21.920
that is

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.660
128

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:23.160
source

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:23.480
that is

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:23.980
128

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:24.760
we'll not

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.140
run out

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:25.580
of that

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.620
there probably

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.600
you know

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.220
more than

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:29.880
grains of sand

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.200
on this

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:30.460
earth

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.200
right

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.280
2 to the

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:33.680
128

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.220
is a giant

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:34.540
number

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:35.860
payload

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.420
length

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.260
that's the

01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:37.440
length

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:37.660
of a

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:37.820
payload

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:38.160
you don't

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.660
need the

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:38.960
internet

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.240
header

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:39.540
length

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.560
because it's

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:40.860
fixed

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.300
so a

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:41.560
payload

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:41.860
length

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.260
is everything

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:42.580
that comes

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:42.860
after

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:44.960
next header

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.400
next header

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:46.700
means

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:47.140
particle

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:47.620
which

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:47.960
particle

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.240
is going

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:48.660
to end up

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.320
in the

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:49.560
header

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:49.900
after

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:50.660
meaning

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.100
whatever

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:52.440
starts

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:52.900
here

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.240
right

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.100
is not

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:55.300
just

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:55.940
playing data

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:56.420
it's another

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:56.800
particle

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.320
like

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:57.800
transport

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.300
or

01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:58.640
another

01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.520
or something

01:04:59.520 --> 01:04:59.820
else

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.460
so you

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:00.720
need to

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.060
tell

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.380
the

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:02.580
IP

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:02.820
header

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:03.680
to which

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:03.940
particle

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:04.340
to pass

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:04.560
this

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.080
next

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.740
hop limit

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:07.320
that's the

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.020
time to live

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:08.720
that's still

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.200
there

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.080
right

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:10.540
but it's

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:11.080
2,

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:11.360
3,

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:11.680
4,

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.080
5,

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:12.460
6,

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:12.700
7,

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.080
8

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:13.460
now

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.240
ok

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:15.540
same

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:16.940
shouldn't

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:17.340
be hopping

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:17.660
too much

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:18.260
but in fact

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:18.620
the number

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:18.880
of hops

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.100
on the

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:19.360
internet

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:19.860
has gone

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.200
down

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:20.580
over the

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:20.860
years

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:22.020
you know

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:22.320
why

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.180
big ASPs

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:25.140
big giant

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:25.640
ASPs

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.000
long haul

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:27.780
lines

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:28.740
without

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:29.160
problems

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:29.360
right

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:29.680
so you

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.160
can basically

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:30.660
do one

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:30.980
hop

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:31.800
and cross

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.340
most of

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:32.700
the US

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:33.020
in one

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:33.200
hop

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.780
so

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.440
if you

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:35.640
do

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.240
just for

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:36.540
fun

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:37.160
pick your

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.120
most exotic

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:38.540
location

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:38.740
in

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:38.920
India

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.240
you can

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:39.580
think of

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:39.800
like

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.140
again

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.500
Slabonia

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.060
or Kravistan

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:43.600
somewhere

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:43.880
and

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.440
try

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:44.760
to do

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:44.880
a

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:55.160

a

01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:58.560
this

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:58.760

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:03.220

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:03.340
this

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:03.500
like

a

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:05.440
again

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:05.660
it's

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:05.900
one

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:08.620
the

that's

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:16.420
what

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:21.380
is

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:21.700
really

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:22.000
for

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:22.420

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:22.820
ID

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.100
think

about

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:25.800

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:28.900
the

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.100
this

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:33.340
page

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.400
but

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:35.580
there's

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:35.720
no

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.100
connection

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:36.320
as

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:36.600
such

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:36.900
right

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.260
because

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:38.660
IP

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:38.800
is

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.180
connection

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.640
okay

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:41.820
so

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:42.000
this

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.120
is

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:42.300
just

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:42.420
a

side

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:42.760
by

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:42.980

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:43.420
comparison

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:43.740
with

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:43.760
the

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:43.920
same

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.260
things

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.980
so

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:47.300
yes

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:47.920
IPv6

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.120
Harry

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:48.260
is

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:48.640
longer

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.180
because

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:49.360
the

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:49.700
addresses

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:49.900
are

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:50.080
much

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:50.400
longer

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.300
but

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:51.580
in

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:51.760
terms

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:51.920
of

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.160
like

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:52.960
its

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.260
format

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:53.500
it's

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:53.840
cleaner

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.380
smaller

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:54.780
right

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.900
so

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:57.160
in

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:57.260
the

01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:57.440
rest

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:57.560
of

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:57.660
this

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:57.840
we're

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:57.940
going

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:58.000
to

use

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.240
IPv4

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.660
so

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:00.820
what

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:00.940
is

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.920
you

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:19.380
it

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:19.500
would

either

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:23.900
way

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:25.400
yeah

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:25.580
I

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:25.740
could

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:25.940
see

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:26.320
that

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:26.760
but

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.220
just

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:27.420
the

the

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:29.940
you

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:30.200
said

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.120
by

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:31.840
subtly

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.340
changing

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.020
something

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:33.220
in

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:33.320
the

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:33.500
header

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:33.840
okay

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.840
remember

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.220
that

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:36.920
quality

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.040
that

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:39.280
could

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:39.640
change

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:39.820
the

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:40.020
route

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.020
so

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:41.180
for

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:41.460
example

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:41.680
you

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:41.880
might

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.140
send

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.320

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:45.620
let's

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:45.860
say

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.600

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.160

sensitive

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.440
than

01:08:59.440 --> 01:08:59.660
let's

01:08:59.660 --> 01:08:59.760
say

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.080

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:00.940
you

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:07.620

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:07.740
there

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:07.840
is

some

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:12.240
when

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:12.360
you

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.080
you

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:19.220
see

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:27.220
you

don't

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:28.920
you

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.020
know

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:29.100
what

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:33.740
more

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:34.160
relaxed

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.480
right

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:35.660
when

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:35.840
you're

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:36.260
downloading

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:36.480
your

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:36.800
file

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.740
the

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.040
delay

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:39.400
requirements

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:39.680
are not

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:39.840
that

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:40.280
stringent

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:40.840
so

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.020
there's

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:41.140
all

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:41.380
different

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:41.780
qualities

01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:41.980
of

01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:42.280
service

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:42.920
my

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.240
guess

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:43.420
is

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:43.880
because

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.100
of

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:44.820
changing

01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:45.100
that

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:45.420
quality

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:45.600
of

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:45.900
service

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:46.580
field

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:46.980
you

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:47.200
get

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:47.560
different

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:47.900
routes

01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:49.100
I

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:49.260
don't

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:49.480
think

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:49.680
by

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.040
changing

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:50.400
packet

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:50.920
lengths

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.840
I

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.280
assume

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:52.480
you're

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:52.680
talking

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:52.860
about

01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.080
same

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:53.360
source

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:53.560
same

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.040
destination

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:54.400
right

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.680
yeah

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.020
I can

01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:56.180
see

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:56.400
that

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:56.800
and

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:56.920
you

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.040
could

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:57.420
definitely

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.200
change

01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.300
traverse

01:09:59.300 --> 01:09:59.680
different

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:00.160
countries

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.880
right

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.680
by changing

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:02.920
so

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.300
again

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:03.660
if you're

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:03.940
within

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:04.220
one

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:04.700
country

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.300
I mean

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:06.680
political

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.060
entity

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:07.480
I don't

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:07.860
see that

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:08.180
happening

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:08.480
so

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.020
I

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:09.420
suspect

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:09.740
what you're

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:09.980
talking

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:10.200
about

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:10.480
since you

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:10.640
said

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.100
censorship

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.120
that this

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:12.480
would be

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:12.960
across

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:13.700
borders

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.220
but

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:16.500
anyway

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.700
maybe not

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:18.000
I mean

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:18.520
if you're

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:18.880
already in

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.220
a country

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:19.640
that does

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.020
censorship

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:20.320
maybe

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.220
that doesn't

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:21.420
work

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.100
so

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.180
the

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:24.500
security

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:24.840
model

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.260
for IP

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:25.520
yeah

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.060
sorry

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:26.380
just very

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:26.780
quickly

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.400
do

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.540
users

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.620
or I guess

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:30.960
both the

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.460
server and

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.000
the client

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.820
do they

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.320
get to

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:33.680
choose

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.020
what type

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:34.400
of traffic

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:34.700
they are

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:35.120
doesn't that

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:35.640
violate

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.320
the security

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:36.780
principle

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:37.040
about

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:37.600
resources

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.580
in IP

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.360
yeah

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:39.760
well

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:40.080
no no

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:40.160
no

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:40.660
that's not

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:40.820
like

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.300
SSL

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:41.680
TLS

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:41.960
right

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:42.160
or

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:42.500
HTTP

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.420
in IP

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.220
layer

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:45.080
you don't

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:45.900
really choose

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:46.300
it's more

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:46.600
like

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.200
first of all

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:48.540
there's no

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:48.780
server

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.140
client

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:50.260
I mean

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:50.840
like in

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.140
the sense

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:51.500
of like

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:51.800
there's

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:51.960
some

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.080
resources

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:54.400
right

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:54.760
and there's

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.240
some users

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:55.940
yeah

01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:56.460
and

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:56.740
so

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:57.060
could you

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.140
it's in their

01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:58.480
interest

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:58.820
to like

01:10:58.820 --> 01:10:59.240
choose the

01:10:59.240 --> 01:10:59.540
best

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.540
yes

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:02.160
are you

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:02.520
saying

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.300
can a

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:03.920
user of

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.540
a computer

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:05.660
like a

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.080
laptop

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.840
hack into

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.280
IP

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.660
implementation

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:11.220
locally

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.460
and fix

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.240
that field

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:14.940
right

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:15.680
and change

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.040
IP

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:16.720
so that

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:17.620
it will

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:18.300
always put

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:18.900
the highest

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:19.880
priority

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.420
kind of

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:20.640
UI

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.480
yes

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:21.500
yes

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:21.940
you can

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:22.600
get

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:22.620
get

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:23.500
yourself

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.060
Linux

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:24.840
hack

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.000
it

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.340
source

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.060
available

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:27.840
you can

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.300
go into

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:28.720
the IP

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.400
implementation

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:29.880
and do

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.260
that

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.700
I don't

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:32.220
think there's

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:32.600
any way

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.080
to prevent

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:33.400
that

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.940
but

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:37.440
the other

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:37.780
way

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:38.280
packets

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:38.960
coming back

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.500
may not

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.180
care about

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:42.520
what you

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:42.700
say

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:42.900
right

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:43.240
so your

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:43.560
packets

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:43.780
might

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.200
get a

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:45.680
preferential

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.100
treatment

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:46.540
but the

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.200
return packets

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:47.920
won't

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:48.440
unless you

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:48.840
agree

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:49.440
unless you

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:49.700
hack

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:50.020
both

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.180
say I'm

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:53.660
Netflix

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.100
why would

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:55.460
I not

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:55.980
want to

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:56.600
make my

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.160
QS

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:57.700
the best

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:58.940
and sure

01:11:58.940 --> 01:11:59.420
buffering

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:00.220
but I don't

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:00.780
want buffering

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:01.800
for my

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:02.500
users

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.400
yeah I

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.120
don't know

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:06.680
you could

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.260
I suspect

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:07.780
you could

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.740
can Netflix

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.760
detect anything

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.500
that you're

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.100
messing with

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:11.980
probably not

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:12.680
no I mean

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:13.360
from Netflix

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.160
oh from

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:14.440
Netflix

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.340
well they have

01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:15.700
to be good

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:16.500
corporate citizens

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.600
right because

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.040
people can

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:18.660
inspect their

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:19.080
packets

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.540
right IP

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.200
packet headers

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:21.720
are visible

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.060
so this packet

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:25.920
inspection can

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.620
say ISP

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:27.040
will say

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.280
they even

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:28.700
Netflix

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:29.560
themselves have

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.320
a long distance

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.320
at least ISP

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.400
and like the

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.160
borders Netflix

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:33.800
right and they'll

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.440
say what the

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:34.780
hell are you

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.120
doing

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.680
you are choking

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.180
all the other

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:37.880
traffic out

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.740
I mean they do

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:41.300
they do

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.120
but they still

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:42.680
use the rest

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:42.840
of the

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.000
even if they

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:44.480
are their own

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:44.880
ISP

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.380
I mean their

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.100
border other

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:46.480
what's called

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:46.940
autonomous

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:47.360
domains

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.140
and those

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:48.480
will come

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:48.680
play

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.260
so the

01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:50.720
IP security

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.220
one is like

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:51.420
this

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:51.620
yeah

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.900
I mean I

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:53.380
will use the

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:54.140
word machines

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:54.640
hosts

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.220
but what are

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:55.580
we really

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:56.200
talking about

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.080
is interfaces

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.640
right

01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.640
because IP

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.500
address is not

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.060
a host

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:01.360
address

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.240
it's an

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:02.620
address of

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.040
an interface

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:03.940
you can have

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:04.560
a device that

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:05.140
have multiple

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:05.820
IP addresses

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.080
right

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:07.860
you do in

01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:08.200
fact have

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:08.740
devices with

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.260
multiple IP

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:09.560
addresses

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.920
all your

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.660
phones and

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.320
laptops have

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:13.980
multiple IP

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:14.320
addresses

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.420
but just

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.140
simplifies things

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:18.500
like this

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.700
so it

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:20.480
considers that

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.400
you can

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.020
essentially

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.540
secure these

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.740
routers and

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:26.400
secure the

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:26.820
hosts

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.140
right

01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.560
but what you

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.280
cannot secure

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:29.980
fundamentally

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.000
is these

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.900
communication

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:33.580
links

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.960
so here

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:35.600
from the

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.120
host to

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:36.240
the

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:36.380
right

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:36.620
and I

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:36.960
imagine

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.400
that this

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:38.880
picture really

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:39.300
shows you

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:39.640
more like

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.620
an organizational

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.060
network

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:41.380
right

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.220
think about

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.080
this is like

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:43.520
UCI

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.440
and this is

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.160
UCLA

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.220
and in

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:48.840
between here

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.400
it's only

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.320
a short

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.160
yellow line

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:51.720
but this

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.280
is in fact

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.360
a potentially

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.260
giant distance

01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:55.220
right

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.020
many hops

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.080
it is the

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:57.440
internet

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.100
in between

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.380
so we don't

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:00.240
trust anything

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:00.600
that is

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.360
between

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.200
the boundary

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:02.920
of UCI

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:03.500
and UCLA

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.520
but we also

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.160
don't trust

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.420
anything here

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.340
within UCI

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:08.220
because no

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.180
we're using

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.380
the ether

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.300
and you know

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:12.860
maybe we don't

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.320
even trust

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.280
OIT so much

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.040
because they

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:16.760
run all the

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.380
wired infrastructure

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:19.980
so that's the

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:20.520
outlook from

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.120
my BSEC

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:21.660
point of view

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:22.300
that we don't

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.000
trust the

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:23.360
wires

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.320
and it

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:27.720
comes in

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:27.860
two

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.240
well

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.080
it comes in

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:29.320
two

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:29.860
what's called

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.040
format flavors

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:31.820
and two

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:32.120
modes

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:32.580
and this is

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:33.040
confusing

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:33.920
I already

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.260
can warn you

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:36.620
has two

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.000
formats

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:37.820
one is called

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:38.560
ESP

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.220
another is called

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:39.680
AH

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:41.260
that one is

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:41.680
simpler

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.460
authentication

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:43.880
header

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.320
and

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.160
encapsulating

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.000
security payload

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.960
and they

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:48.460
all work

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:48.840
together

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.300
with something

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:49.880
we will not

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:50.180
cover

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:50.880
because it

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.300
is just

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.040
too damn

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:52.400
boring

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:52.780
and too

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:53.220
difficult

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.080
to cover

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:54.420
in this

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:54.680
kind of

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:55.060
course

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:55.980
called IP

01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.920
security policy

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.320
and something

01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:57.600
called

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:57.980
Ike

01:14:57.980 --> 01:14:58.680
internet key

01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:58.940
exchange

01:14:58.940 --> 01:14:59.740
so unlike

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:00.340
TLS

01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.040
I will not

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:02.440
be telling

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.120
you a lot

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:03.740
about how

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:04.060
keys

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:04.660
are established

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.740
because that's

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.260
a separate

01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:07.680
thing

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.560
in SSL

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.020
CLS

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:09.320
key

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:09.720
establishment

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.220
is like

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:11.080
part and parcel

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:11.500
of all the

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:11.780
actual

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:12.040
part

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.820
okay

01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:14.840
cover is

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.020
true

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:15.300
right

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.640
but in

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.080
IPSEC

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:17.480
it's not

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.060
it's

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:18.360
something

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:18.900
it's like

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:19.560
a separate

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.160
component

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:21.660
called

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:22.020
Ike

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:27.620
so what does

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.300
IPSEC do

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:29.180
only a couple

01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:29.680
more minutes

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.340
and we're done

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:32.080
it provides

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.240
security in

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:33.900
three cases

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:34.800
but not only

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.800
the main

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.700
three use cases

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.200
host to host

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.040
meaning interface

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:39.480
to source

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.160
to destination

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.120
okay

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.620
end to end

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.060
security

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.080
it also

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:45.740
provides

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:46.780
host to gateway

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.760
which means

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.120
the typical

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:49.840
scenario I want

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.280
you to think

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.240
about is that

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:51.820
you work for a

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:52.860
company and

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:53.760
you have a host

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.320
your laptop

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.780
and you're in a

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:56.420
hotel room

01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:57.400
in Slabonia

01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.140
okay

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.240
some godforsaken

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:01.620
place

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.560
and you want

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:02.900
to connect

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:03.320
by the

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:03.840
untrusted

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.760
internet

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.260
right

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.560
over to

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.080
the home

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.140
office

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:09.400
so your

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:09.960
home office

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.500
has a

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:11.900
gateway

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:12.400
a router

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:12.700
right

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:13.060
a gateway

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:13.540
is basically

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:13.960
a border

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:14.260
router

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.140
and so

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.320
that whole

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:18.740
wilderness

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:19.360
between your

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:19.720
laptop

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.340
and that

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:20.540
border

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:20.860
router

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:21.520
needs to

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:22.060
be secured

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:22.720
and that's

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.260
what IPSEC

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:23.520
will do

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:23.800
for you

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:23.980
too

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.540
and then

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:26.860
gateway

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.360
to gateway

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:27.900
that's more

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:28.360
like thinking

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:28.660
about

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:29.100
again

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:30.020
the UCI

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:30.420
UCLA

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:30.960
example

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.600
on a

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:32.160
previous slide

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.420
that's more

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.060
like how do

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:37.520
we secure

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.260
gateway

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:38.900
to gateway

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.060
right

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:45.280
and you

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:45.660
can also

01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:46.080
have

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.760
all combinations

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.180
there are

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:48.700
like you can

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:49.440
secure end

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:49.860
to end

01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:50.440
and also

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.520
on top of

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:51.780
that

01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:52.220
gateway

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:52.660
to gateway

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.660
okay

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:55.440
you can

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.120
concatenate

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:56.240
them

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:56.500
you can

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:56.760
have

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:57.380
host to

01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:57.800
gateway

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.700
IPSEC

01:16:58.700 --> 01:16:59.940
then separate

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:00.540
gateway to

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:01.340
gateway IPSEC

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:01.740
and another

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:02.300
gateway to

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.100
host IPSEC

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.460
IPSEC is

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.780
very malleable

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.640
very flexible

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:07.980
I guess

01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.500
right

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.220
so

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.520
typical

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.200
and it has

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:12.800
these also

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.460
two modes

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.180
which we

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:14.500
don't have

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:15.000
time to

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:15.400
discuss

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.260
called tunnel

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:17.320
and transport

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.440
I guess

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.140
that means

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:21.120
not a lot

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.680
of IPSEC

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.140
questions

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:23.460
on your

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:23.820
big jump

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:24.180
sadly

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:27.480
but you

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:27.800
have time

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.140
to read

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:28.660
I will post

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:28.940
this

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.680
I just won't

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.000
be asking

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:31.620
very detailed

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:32.020
questions

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:34.000
alright

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.360
good luck

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:35.900
to y'all

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.180
for next

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:37.580
Tuesday

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:40.520
please

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:41.160
prepare

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.260
I will

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:43.720
have office

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.200
hours on

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:44.520
Monday

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.340
typically

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:46.860
people want

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:47.180
for some

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:47.340
reason

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:47.800
come and

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.340
visit me

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:48.980
before the

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:49.280
midterm

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:49.520
on the

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:49.800
final

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.260
I don't

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:50.420
know why

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:50.840
that is

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.500
yeah

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.060
and

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.320
be on

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:55.580
time
