WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
like SSL that we're going to go over later and there's some wireless, I think it ends

00:09.000 --> 00:17.000
with some firewalls which also will go in depth and wireless.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
Any questions from us?

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
So again, I would like to have your new proposals by next Tuesday, like last time.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
If you have any fundamental questions there about what I expect, ask.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
I'll have officers on Monday.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Again, I want to deal with two people.

00:49.000 --> 00:59.000
No double dipping means not to use material that you did already or you're doing in parallel

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
in some other course.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
So there has to be something distinct that you do for this part.

01:07.000 --> 01:17.000
And if you plan to do writing, survey or something like that, no chatbots.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
That should be you.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
If you do use some tools that you are not sure, or you want to use some tools, you're not quite sure if this transcends the boundary, just ask.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
It's easier to ask now than to explain later.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Okay, so user authentication, one of the basic topics in computer security.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
How do we authenticate humans?

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
That means us.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
All right, basic problem.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
Somebody claims to be Alice or Bob, and now how do you prove that you are that Alice or Bob?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Now why do we do authentication?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
We do authentication in order to enforce access control.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
All right, just authentication for the sake of authentication isn't useful.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
What's the point of authenticating you if nothing happens?

02:17.000 --> 02:27.000
And any form of, any time you are asked for anything that identifies you and authenticates you, it's for some purpose.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Whether it's a policeman that stops you and says, where's your driver's license?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
The driver's license is to let you go.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
If you authenticate you, you let you go.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Then you get a ticket.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
And without the driver's license, you might get arrested.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
So no access to driving privileges, right?

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
If you work for a company, you use a badge and maybe sometimes a camera to authenticate you as an employee, right?

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
So you can have access to the premises.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
You get into the UCI's Google space, right?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Google Docs and Drive space.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
You authenticate it via a dual and password username so you can get access to those resources, et cetera, et cetera.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
So there's always a reason for why you are being authenticated, right?

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
There is something that you are given access to if you succeed in authentication.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Okay.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
So this pops up just about everywhere.

03:25.000 --> 03:34.000
So, of course, as you know, there are many ways to prove that you are.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Say you are.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
The most familiar ones are passwords.

03:38.000 --> 03:48.000
Their demise has been predicted for the last 40 years, and yet they are still here.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Moreover, they show no signs of going away anytime soon.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
An interesting parallel, email.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Email has been around since early 80s.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Pretty much the same way it is used to be.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
Maybe the WYSIWYG changed, you know, the here and there, but the interfaces, et cetera.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
But email is pretty much the same.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Same format email addresses, and every year somebody says, yeah, I guarantee it.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
You know, it's like a doomsday.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
You say, oh, yeah, the end of the world is coming tomorrow.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Just you wait.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
And tomorrow comes, ah, you know what?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
My clock was wrong.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I was like, yeah, it missed you.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Anyway, ah, the stars did not align.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
So the same thing about email and password, doomsday predictions.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Email is still here.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Password is still here.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
No signing going on.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Right.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
So passwords we know, and nobody loves them, but we're used to them.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
And then we have passphrases, right?

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Or answers to personal questions.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Like, what color eyes do you like the most?

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
Or, what was the make of your first automobile?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Really difficult questions, right?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
And then there are, of course, secret keys, right?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
So we can use some secret keys.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
If you can remember them, you can use them, right?

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Or you can write them down, which will be a lot of fun.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
But these are things you know, presumably.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Pins are, of course, another form.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
It's a variation of the theme of passwords, right?

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
Because they're supposed to be numbers, not alphanumeric characters.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Then you can do authentication based on where you are.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
So that is, if you are in some space, and you can prove you are in some space, geographical

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
location, then you must have access to something.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
You might be giving access to something.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Like, if you are in some secure room in the Pentagon, by virtue of being in that secure

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
room, you're allowed to access some computer system or some database.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm not saying that's how it should be, but it can be like that.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
It could also be an IP address given to you by your internet provider.

06:06.000 --> 06:15.000
So, for example, if you live in the campus housing, your entry is provided by UCI, right?

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
As opposed to, say, me, I also live on campus, Canada campus, I think on Union Hills here,

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
next to campus, my address is provided by Cox.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
And all my neighbors are in the cost of Google to buy them.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
So the IP address tells you something.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
If you believe me, the IP address, of course.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
It could be home phone, right?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Of course, people don't use home phones anymore, right?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Landlines are rare.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Cell phone.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Cell phone used to be able to, many, many, many years ago, if you had a certain cell phone number,

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
then you had to be in a particular space, because back then there was no roaming, right?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
So if your phone number worked, that means you were, you know, with a 949 area code,

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
you were in North County.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
It doesn't work anymore.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
Now, MAC addresses, could they be used for identifying where you are, right?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Or for anything at all?

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
Everybody knows what MAC addresses is, right?

07:18.000 --> 07:27.000
Theoretically, MAC addresses supposed to tell you something about the interface of the device.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Any ideas?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
No?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Too early?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
MAC addresses have a special format.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
They actually should tell you who the manufacturer of the device, or the interface.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
It doesn't tell you necessarily where you are, and that's why I put a question mark there.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Also, MAC addresses are impermanent.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
There was a time when most devices that have MAC addresses, you couldn't change them.

07:50.000 --> 08:02.000
Today, you can change MAC addresses on most laptops, industrial or desktop systems, most laptops, cell phones, and other guys.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
Also, even if MAC addresses were impermanent, MAC addresses are only used for the one hub, right?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
That's a data link layer.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
So, in this room, the MAC address is only visible to the access point.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But beyond the access point, it has no meaning, right?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
There's nothing.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It doesn't longer go there.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
Okay, then there's what you are as a human, right?

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
Now, what you are are your intrinsic features, like your DNA, right?

08:33.000 --> 08:44.000
Your fingerprints, your eyes, your face geometry, your hand geometry, your vein pattern on your wrist.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
There's gait, where you are, not a very good biometric, but that's in you.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
All kinds of other things.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
And then there is the one that you are familiar with the most, which is what you have, right?

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
It's a possession of something.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
We know this, right?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
This is the most frequent two-factor.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
You have the app on your phone, and it's visually secure.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
You trust the app.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
The app will pop up, right?

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
Either with the approve, disapprove, or a code, right?

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
The temporary code, that essentially, by entering that code or hitting approve,

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
you're saying, I'm in possession of this phone.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
And because this phone has been pre-registered as associated with you,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
there's a reasonable assumption that because you have this phone,

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
and previously you entered the right password and username,

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
must be the case that you are a police agent.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And if you think of it, any other?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Might I miss something?

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Any other basis upon which you can be authenticated?

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
What you know, where you are, what you are, what you have.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
Some people suggested where you've been, but that's hard to remember.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
So, how do our passwords work?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
No.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Quiet track.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
No.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Without a sign.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
So, must not be able to remember.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Right.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
So, you have a secret password.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
You pick the secret password, and the system checks to authenticate that password.

10:25.000 --> 10:32.000
Now, sometimes, of course, you don't pick the secret password,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
sometimes the secret password is given to you.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Like, how many of you have used a browser to select a secret password?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Then you don't actually know anything.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Right?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
All you do is, what?

10:42.000 --> 10:51.000
You log into your computer, or your, uh, smartphone computer, like that.

10:51.000 --> 10:58.000
And, the idea is that the browser, especially something like Chrome, let's say.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
I want to pick, I use Firefox sometimes here, but let's say Chrome, which is popular.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Um, you also have to log into your profile, right?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
On Chrome.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
So, you log into the computer, you log into the browser, but the browser doesn't know what

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
you log into the computer.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
So, in fact, you log into your profile on Chrome, and that essentially unlocks the so-called

11:21.000 --> 11:30.000
password vault, or password bundle, that is stored in your profile on Chrome.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Not super reassuring, right?

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
But, convenient, because as long as you use that Chrome, right?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Actually, it doesn't have to be Chrome there, right?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You could be using Chrome somewhere else.

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
You know, if you set it up correctly, that password that Chrome picked for you will be available

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
once you authenticate with the right folder.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Right.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
So, initialization, but typically the password initialization is you pick the password based

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
on some password rules.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
Which vary, of course, from site to site, from time to time.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
And, um, how do you actually communicate with the log in time for the first time, right?

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Or for subsequent times, right?

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
There is always this risk of eavesdropping.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Right?

12:17.000 --> 12:26.000
So, if you imagine the most naive way of communicating a password is you type your password and then

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
it just goes somewhere.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
Now, if it's a local computer, maybe you can have a little more trust.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
You trust the operating system that the log in prompt is actually from the operating system.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Right?

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
So, when you turn on your laptop, you have tablets and laptops, and when you open it, so turn

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
it on, and the log in prompt occurs, and says, usually it doesn't say username, right?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
You can't, right?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
But usually it just ends your password.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Do you know who's asking you for a password?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Who's still a computer?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Do you know who's asking?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Should be the operating system.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Should be the operating system.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Is it the operating system?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Do you have any way to verify that, in fact, the window that shows you the login is the operating

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
system window?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I say no.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I don't think you know.

13:03.000 --> 13:29.000
Maybe if you have an encrypted disk, would you type in your password and connect it for

13:29.000 --> 13:40.380
But even then, I mean, if it just scrolls the right things, it says bias, blah blah blah blah, authenticating, initializing, enterprise, you don't know.

13:41.020 --> 13:51.820
So, I'm not trying to cause panic here, but you should be aware that, so you have a little more sure when your computer is doing a cold boot, right?

13:51.820 --> 13:55.540
Because it's functionally like turned off, although that's a whole other story.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.180
How do you know your device is turned off?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.360
We will touch upon this in a couple of days.

14:01.360 --> 14:10.120
You often tell it to turn off, you press the button, and how do you know it's off?

14:10.120 --> 14:13.560
Well, you say, well, you know what, I'll just unplug it from the wall.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.900
Are you sure that's on?

14:16.740 --> 14:17.980
Are you sure there's no battery?

14:19.400 --> 14:20.980
Do you know what's inside the device?

14:22.340 --> 14:24.240
They have CMOS battery, too.

14:24.240 --> 14:31.160
Ah, yeah, but you should like disassembling the device, voiding the warranty, and causing electric shock, potentially.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.160
So, actually, you don't.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.640
So, that's a depressing thought, right?

14:34.680 --> 14:37.420
You actually don't know who is asking for the password.

14:37.900 --> 14:38.720
But we trust.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.180
Okay, but that's the password that goes to your operating system, right?

14:43.320 --> 14:45.420
It doesn't go on the wire, right?

14:45.520 --> 14:46.620
It's not sent anywhere.

14:46.620 --> 14:56.240
What about if you're logging into Facebook, or, you know, your Instagram, or whatever, your favorite website, or any kind of service?

14:56.500 --> 14:57.820
Like, you're going into UCI.

14:58.440 --> 15:04.800
A window pops up that looks like UCI's little pop-up, with blue and stuff, you know, all the right colors.

15:04.940 --> 15:06.600
How busy is this to copy?

15:06.600 --> 15:09.680
So, you enter your password, and then it goes.

15:10.000 --> 15:10.700
So, you don't know.

15:11.700 --> 15:17.480
But let's suspend our disbelief, and say, okay, we trust that it goes, it goes to the right place, okay, okay, okay.

15:18.620 --> 15:20.200
But what about how is it sent?

15:21.100 --> 15:22.680
Is it sent in clear text?

15:24.760 --> 15:25.620
That's bad, right?

15:25.700 --> 15:28.280
It can't be sent in clear text, because then it gets used to the other part.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.500
Okay, well, you hope that actually in reality, it sends over a secure connection.

15:33.500 --> 15:45.100
And sort of prior to you entering the password, whatever the stub application, whether it's a browser, a client browser, or some other application on your laptop, or your phone,

15:45.420 --> 15:52.080
has already established a secure, usually TLS, or VPN connection, to the other end.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.700
But even then, you might not trust that connection.

15:58.700 --> 16:05.820
So, probably not a good idea to send the password unencrypted, even over the connection.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.420
So, what's typically done is the password is, like, hashed.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.220
Remember hash functions, right?

16:13.120 --> 16:13.520
Yeah.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.600
Now the question is, where is it hashed?

16:16.700 --> 16:18.800
So, who gets to see your password locally?

16:19.360 --> 16:22.400
Maybe it's hashed in software, with a client software.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.300
Maybe it's hashed in hardware.

16:26.980 --> 16:30.960
Maybe there's a way for the login prompt, or if it presents you with a password prompt,

16:31.200 --> 16:34.780
to communicate directly to some hardware inside your laptop of a smartphone,

16:35.280 --> 16:38.280
that actually takes that password, hashes it, and that's it.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.700
And then there's a template resistant, because if it's not, maybe, you know, somebody can hack it.

16:43.700 --> 16:48.280
And then, how does the other end check the password?

16:49.200 --> 16:53.540
Well, and of course, is your password guessable?

16:54.180 --> 16:54.380
Right?

16:54.920 --> 16:58.420
None of this other stuff is important if your password is weak.

17:00.260 --> 17:00.520
Right?

17:00.540 --> 17:03.220
If I can, with reasonable probability, guess your password,

17:03.480 --> 17:09.740
all the other measures to prevent theft and misuse of password, they're useless.

17:09.740 --> 17:15.320
Because guessing a password means somebody is going to try to log in, just like you would.

17:16.560 --> 17:20.980
So, whatever measures are taken after you enter a password and hit return,

17:21.100 --> 17:23.100
they're useless if the password is being guessed.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.280
Also, on most operating systems, it's difficult to keep a password file secret.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.920
Especially like multi-user systems.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.180
So, I know that you are all used to, essentially, single-user computers, right?

17:39.740 --> 17:44.160
I mean, how many people usually have, like, multiple profiles on their Android?

17:44.600 --> 17:46.980
I mean, you can do it, but it's a pain.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.340
How many of you share your laptop with others?

17:51.160 --> 17:53.320
My guess is not many, if any.

17:54.640 --> 17:58.700
Maybe when you were younger, and you had, like, a sibling, and you shared your laptop.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.700
Or the parent will let you use their laptop and create an account.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.460
But most people, like, you're 80, they don't share laptops.

18:06.460 --> 18:11.600
So, this does not seem relevant to you, but think about a bigger world out there.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.180
Like, an organization.

18:15.800 --> 18:19.100
Where you have multiple users, multiple, many users,

18:19.680 --> 18:22.460
and they all need to log in and access the same system.

18:22.460 --> 18:29.540
So, you need to store the password database somewhere, the password file, right?

18:30.540 --> 18:35.100
And so, in modern systems, at least one of the Unix derived,

18:35.520 --> 18:37.980
historically, the password file is accessible.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.960
It's called world-readable.

18:42.360 --> 18:46.920
And the reason it's world-readable is because it's not just the password file.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.820
It's, essentially, the user database.

18:48.820 --> 18:55.840
And so, programs that run on Linux, or Unix, and whatever,

18:56.060 --> 18:58.700
all these Unix-derived operating systems,

18:59.040 --> 19:01.940
they need to consult that file, not for the password's sake,

19:02.680 --> 19:08.360
but for account's sake, to figure out what accounts have rights for what resources.

19:09.380 --> 19:10.900
So, it's mostly for access control.

19:11.740 --> 19:11.920
Okay?

19:12.520 --> 19:16.680
This was done a long time ago, when Unix first was born, in the 80s.

19:16.680 --> 19:21.020
Now, with hard-to-remember passwords,

19:22.600 --> 19:25.700
if you don't pick a weak password, you pick a hard-to-remember password, you're good.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.480
And if your memory is good, wonderful.

19:30.620 --> 19:33.360
But what about reusing passwords?

19:34.940 --> 19:37.640
A lot of people can remember one difficult password.

19:38.780 --> 19:39.060
Right?

19:39.060 --> 19:41.500
I'm sure you can remember one difficult password.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.680
That is not, by any standard, weak.

19:46.360 --> 19:49.260
But then, can you remember 10, 15?

19:49.780 --> 19:52.800
These days, most of us have well over 10,

19:52.960 --> 19:55.980
some of us, I would say, around 20 different accounts.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.040
There have been some studies about this, but I don't think it's an immediate number.

19:59.040 --> 20:06.880
You could carry around an object, like some kind of a device, like a smartphone,

20:07.120 --> 20:11.520
maybe, that has your passwords all stored there in plain text.

20:12.140 --> 20:14.940
And you unlock your phone, you access your password, and you're like, oh, great.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.440
What if you don't have your phone?

20:16.700 --> 20:18.060
What if somebody steals your phone?

20:18.060 --> 20:23.780
What if a malicious app on the phone exfiltrated that file?

20:25.300 --> 20:30.040
So there is a cottage industry out there called, you know, Password Vault.

20:30.220 --> 20:31.980
Maybe, have anybody used Password Vault?

20:33.760 --> 20:39.540
I mean, some of them are, there are some free, but most of them are cost-mine.

20:40.380 --> 20:42.380
And some companies do use those.

20:43.740 --> 20:46.220
Okay, but guess what?

20:46.220 --> 20:50.340
Well, when you have a company that runs the services, Password Vault Vault,

20:50.620 --> 20:55.960
a third-party Password Vault Vault, they become like honey or a swarm of bees.

20:57.420 --> 21:02.080
They are a super attractive attack target, and just like this DA that we talked about last time,

21:02.980 --> 21:04.880
it's like, attack me.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.420
Because this is where the friendly jewels are.

21:07.560 --> 21:10.880
You get into a password-drawn company, you get into their databases,

21:10.880 --> 21:15.280
whether through outside or inside attack, and you wind up with a big dirt.

21:16.220 --> 21:17.380
Big prize, right?

21:17.640 --> 21:18.380
Tons of passwords.

21:19.540 --> 21:22.100
So I'm not clear that that's a good solution.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.140
Then there's like denial of service issues, right?

21:25.180 --> 21:28.100
If you store your passwords on your phone, if the phone is lost,

21:28.440 --> 21:30.420
or like what happened to me a couple of months ago,

21:30.640 --> 21:32.820
the phone just died, and there's no way.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.740
I mean, it's dead beyond all salvation.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.020
There's no way you can take anything out.

21:37.820 --> 21:40.220
So now it's stuck with having to change all the passwords.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.400
It's like a denial of service.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.980
And for a while, your account's essentially off-limits to you.

21:46.780 --> 21:50.520
One of the more interesting and super easy attacks, by the way,

21:51.640 --> 21:53.280
with a denial of service goal.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.900
Let's say you want to attack a particular company, right?

21:56.960 --> 22:00.020
Let's say you have a company called XYZ Incorporated

22:00.020 --> 22:05.280
that provides access to, I don't know, cute squirrel videos.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.400
And they specialize in cute squirrels only.

22:07.980 --> 22:08.760
No ugly squirrels.

22:08.760 --> 22:13.140
And all the squirrel lovers in the world create accounts there

22:13.140 --> 22:15.320
and just love, you know, it's like popular, right?

22:15.960 --> 22:18.920
So all this community, probably not large,

22:19.040 --> 22:20.460
because how many squirrel lovers out there,

22:20.940 --> 22:24.980
they actively use this service,

22:25.320 --> 22:28.780
and then somebody who wants to just piss them off

22:28.780 --> 22:33.000
or maybe has a competing company decides to mount it in our service.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.760
All they need to do is not break any passwords.

22:38.360 --> 22:42.220
All they need to do is get a large enough sample of the usernames

22:42.220 --> 22:45.420
or people who have an account.

22:46.340 --> 22:48.520
All you do, you can program this.

22:48.640 --> 22:49.980
You can run into this by hand.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.620
Essentially, try to log in.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.820
So for every account, let's say Alice has an account.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.880
Write the username Alice, random password, click.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.920
Username Bob, random password, click.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.460
Do it three times, do it four times,

23:02.540 --> 23:03.580
whatever the little threshold.

23:03.700 --> 23:04.820
Use it, it's a little threshold.

23:05.580 --> 23:07.760
For number of failed logins, right?

23:08.780 --> 23:09.480
What happens?

23:10.300 --> 23:11.700
You're locked out.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.900
So when real users come back to log in,

23:15.320 --> 23:21.020
due to the large number of successive failed login attempts,

23:21.140 --> 23:24.400
you need to contact this 1-800 number in Mauritania.

23:25.020 --> 23:25.620
Good luck.

23:26.300 --> 23:27.200
With awful hours.

23:27.420 --> 23:28.320
With, yes, of course.

23:28.320 --> 23:32.180
We're only open between 3.30 and 4.30 p.m. Hawaii time.

23:32.500 --> 23:32.980
Good luck.

23:33.720 --> 23:34.620
Good luck, right?

23:34.700 --> 23:36.500
Because then, of course, they want to make sure it's you.

23:37.220 --> 23:39.580
Even if it's done in automated fashion

23:39.580 --> 23:40.980
with some other second factor,

23:41.100 --> 23:42.880
all back email, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

23:43.260 --> 23:45.560
It's a giant waste of time.

23:46.840 --> 23:47.800
And a logistical nightmare.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.040
So, a great attack.

23:50.660 --> 23:52.520
You can program a bot to do this, right?

23:52.520 --> 23:57.540
You can go for, like, even random usernames.

23:58.060 --> 24:01.440
Eventually, you're going to find usernames that are existing.

24:02.200 --> 24:02.960
Login, login, login.

24:03.240 --> 24:03.520
Bam.

24:04.020 --> 24:04.560
Locked out.

24:05.540 --> 24:06.900
So, no passwords need to be broken.

24:06.900 --> 24:11.260
So, let's see.

24:11.940 --> 24:13.200
Then there's social engineering.

24:13.400 --> 24:16.540
Social engineering is, like, this whole thing in its own right.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.220
You can teach a class on that, just on social engineering.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.880
But it's not really computer science.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.140
Social engineering is all about how to trick people.

24:26.100 --> 24:28.760
So, maybe more appropriate than psychology or some other department.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.840
But it's a wonderful opportunity for attackers, right?

24:33.920 --> 24:37.380
And a lot of spectacular hacks in this world that you've heard about

24:37.380 --> 24:38.920
that sound really, really technical.

24:40.420 --> 24:44.160
I suspect it's TouchNet and Mirai and all these other things.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.280
I think they all, I'm pretty sure,

24:46.400 --> 24:49.340
they all somehow involve elements of social engineering.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.480
Social engineering means human.

24:53.740 --> 24:54.000
Right?

24:54.000 --> 24:58.500
Human interaction is elicitation of sensitive information

24:58.500 --> 25:01.520
in verbal form.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.660
Non-analog form.

25:04.580 --> 25:04.800
Okay?

25:05.820 --> 25:08.480
The typical social engineering attack

25:08.480 --> 25:10.740
probably doesn't work at night today,

25:10.740 --> 25:11.920
but, you know,

25:13.200 --> 25:14.840
a CIO or a, let's say,

25:14.980 --> 25:16.520
no, it's an IT person,

25:17.520 --> 25:18.980
in the middle of the night,

25:19.060 --> 25:20.860
in some department of some random company,

25:21.220 --> 25:22.800
receives a panicked phone call

25:22.800 --> 25:24.820
from the vice president

25:24.820 --> 25:27.700
of, I don't know,

25:27.760 --> 25:28.580
toilet affairs,

25:28.700 --> 25:29.160
and says,

25:29.380 --> 25:31.460
I am stuck in

25:31.460 --> 25:33.540
Timbuktu

25:33.540 --> 25:34.320
on a

25:34.320 --> 25:36.440
very important company trip.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.740
I'm dealing with clients.

25:38.360 --> 25:39.160
All of a sudden,

25:39.800 --> 25:40.640
my phone broke.

25:41.000 --> 25:41.880
I cannot log in.

25:42.240 --> 25:42.520
Help.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.680
Millions of dollars

25:44.680 --> 25:46.200
of business are at stake.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.240
The panicked IT clerk,

25:48.940 --> 25:49.580
who's sleepy,

25:50.300 --> 25:51.200
and probably has,

25:51.600 --> 25:52.380
I don't know,

25:52.960 --> 25:54.520
DeVry Institute course

25:54.520 --> 25:55.820
or education or something,

25:56.820 --> 25:57.700
says,

25:57.920 --> 25:58.800
oh, of course,

25:59.080 --> 25:59.580
yes, sir.

26:00.020 --> 26:00.760
And says,

26:00.760 --> 26:01.120
okay,

26:01.240 --> 26:02.700
here's a one-time login code,

26:02.760 --> 26:03.300
go in this,

26:03.360 --> 26:03.780
do this.

26:04.920 --> 26:05.160
Yeah,

26:05.280 --> 26:05.700
that's it.

26:06.020 --> 26:06.780
That's the end of it.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.160
That's the back door.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.620
That allows the attacker

26:09.620 --> 26:10.040
to get in.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.560
It's still super common.

26:11.800 --> 26:12.040
Yeah,

26:12.140 --> 26:12.700
I'm sure,

26:12.880 --> 26:13.100
you know,

26:13.180 --> 26:14.560
every once in a while,

26:15.020 --> 26:16.620
in a research literature,

26:17.000 --> 26:17.940
or even at, like,

26:18.020 --> 26:18.640
Black Hat,

26:18.720 --> 26:19.180
DEFCON,

26:19.660 --> 26:20.760
you will hear talks

26:20.760 --> 26:21.420
about people saying,

26:21.520 --> 26:21.740
okay,

26:21.880 --> 26:22.760
we did this kind of

26:22.760 --> 26:23.940
probing attack

26:23.940 --> 26:26.100
against 500 companies

26:26.100 --> 26:26.580
than, like,

26:26.640 --> 26:27.000
Brazil,

26:27.120 --> 26:27.800
I heard one talk.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.500
And the particular talk

26:31.500 --> 26:32.360
I heard is that,

26:32.360 --> 26:33.620
you know,

26:33.680 --> 26:35.540
when this was about

26:35.540 --> 26:36.320
the attacks

26:36.320 --> 26:37.560
on the Brazilian banks,

26:37.840 --> 26:38.060
right,

26:38.140 --> 26:39.220
and essentially utilizing

26:39.220 --> 26:40.000
what I just described,

26:40.140 --> 26:41.320
calling at random hours

26:41.320 --> 26:42.700
and pretending to be somebody.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.000
They didn't even invent somebody.

26:44.080 --> 26:44.720
They actually pretended

26:44.720 --> 26:45.200
to be somebody

26:45.200 --> 26:46.100
who worked for the company.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.140
So, you know,

26:48.200 --> 26:49.560
the hackers know in advance.

26:49.640 --> 26:50.480
They've done their research.

26:50.580 --> 26:50.820
They've looked

26:50.820 --> 26:51.700
for the company charts

26:51.700 --> 26:51.960
and said,

26:52.200 --> 26:52.880
who is awake?

26:53.060 --> 26:54.140
Oh, this guy is on vacation.

26:54.620 --> 26:54.820
So,

26:54.820 --> 26:56.400
it is really believable

26:56.400 --> 26:58.740
when most of it is true.

26:59.660 --> 27:00.240
So, they call it,

27:00.240 --> 27:00.420
say,

27:00.500 --> 27:01.340
I'm so-and-so.

27:01.660 --> 27:02.460
I'm on vacation

27:02.460 --> 27:03.340
in Florida.

27:04.660 --> 27:04.940
Oh,

27:05.660 --> 27:06.020
so-and-so.

27:06.100 --> 27:06.420
Yes,

27:06.540 --> 27:07.160
he's on vacation.

27:08.940 --> 27:09.840
Element of truth

27:09.840 --> 27:10.680
goes a long way.

27:12.260 --> 27:12.460
Right?

27:12.520 --> 27:13.020
That's kind of

27:13.020 --> 27:13.740
human psychology.

27:14.340 --> 27:14.860
It works.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.040
In the U.S.,

27:16.040 --> 27:16.800
there were studies that,

27:16.920 --> 27:17.380
oh, you know,

27:17.440 --> 27:18.460
just like infomercials.

27:18.460 --> 27:18.720
I don't know

27:18.720 --> 27:19.260
if you even know

27:19.260 --> 27:20.280
what infomercials are,

27:20.640 --> 27:22.980
but this is a curious thing.

27:22.980 --> 27:24.980
When Americans listen

27:24.980 --> 27:26.560
to a voice

27:26.560 --> 27:29.040
of a salesman,

27:29.300 --> 27:30.000
it helps

27:30.000 --> 27:30.920
if their voice

27:30.920 --> 27:32.720
has a refined British accent.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.040
Maybe you should wonder why.

27:37.420 --> 27:38.640
If somebody speaks like they're

27:38.640 --> 27:39.520
from the deep south,

27:39.980 --> 27:40.480
forget it.

27:40.820 --> 27:41.980
If somebody speaks like they're

27:41.980 --> 27:43.040
from Brooklyn,

27:43.440 --> 27:44.000
forget it.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.260
But if somebody speaks

27:45.260 --> 27:47.040
with a refined British accent,

27:47.360 --> 27:48.700
carefully enunciating

27:48.700 --> 27:49.980
every single syllable,

27:50.240 --> 27:51.520
I'll do every single word

27:51.520 --> 27:52.100
they say.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.220
Most of us,

27:54.940 --> 27:55.520
this country,

27:56.160 --> 27:56.760
oh, yes,

27:56.860 --> 27:57.240
I'm you.

27:57.700 --> 27:58.240
What can I do?

27:59.320 --> 27:59.520
Right?

27:59.940 --> 28:00.700
So that's part

28:00.700 --> 28:01.420
of social engineering.

28:02.860 --> 28:03.140
Right?

28:03.360 --> 28:03.540
So,

28:04.840 --> 28:05.740
another reason is,

28:05.840 --> 28:06.760
another way that it works

28:06.760 --> 28:07.240
is the attacker

28:07.240 --> 28:08.280
will know some information

28:08.280 --> 28:08.900
about you.

28:09.040 --> 28:09.180
Right?

28:09.240 --> 28:10.480
So if they want to impersonate you

28:10.480 --> 28:11.480
or want to get into your account,

28:11.540 --> 28:12.220
they will know information.

28:12.740 --> 28:13.820
Social security numbers,

28:13.940 --> 28:14.560
days of birth,

28:16.160 --> 28:17.160
those are a lot of difficult

28:17.160 --> 28:18.000
things to find out.

28:18.000 --> 28:18.240
Right?

28:18.360 --> 28:19.160
Social security numbers

28:19.160 --> 28:20.420
used to be believed

28:20.420 --> 28:21.040
to be secret.

28:21.200 --> 28:21.740
Nobody believes

28:21.740 --> 28:22.820
to be secret in these days.

28:23.340 --> 28:24.320
Even though we still

28:24.320 --> 28:25.100
keep them private,

28:25.600 --> 28:26.700
but I can buy

28:26.700 --> 28:27.740
your social security number

28:27.740 --> 28:28.500
if you have one.

28:30.180 --> 28:31.100
It's not going to cost me

28:31.100 --> 28:31.600
very much.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.100
And so if I buy it,

28:33.140 --> 28:33.780
even if it costs me

28:33.780 --> 28:34.660
a couple hundred dollars,

28:35.100 --> 28:36.260
it allows me essentially,

28:36.860 --> 28:37.100
well,

28:37.220 --> 28:38.240
not just social security,

28:38.340 --> 28:39.100
but along with

28:39.100 --> 28:39.700
other information

28:39.700 --> 28:40.460
like David Burr,

28:40.620 --> 28:41.320
driving the last time

28:41.320 --> 28:41.580
in December,

28:41.680 --> 28:42.660
maybe open a bank account

28:42.660 --> 28:43.420
online.

28:45.620 --> 28:46.060
Great.

28:46.060 --> 28:48.460
If I open a bank account,

28:48.580 --> 28:49.400
I can rent something

28:49.400 --> 28:49.960
in your name.

28:51.740 --> 28:52.540
Like an apartment.

28:53.420 --> 28:54.620
Establish a gas company

28:54.620 --> 28:55.880
relationship.

28:56.020 --> 28:56.900
Electrical company.

28:57.100 --> 28:57.220
Right?

28:57.400 --> 28:57.760
Essentially,

28:58.260 --> 28:59.320
start stealing your identity.

29:03.220 --> 29:03.480
Yeah,

29:03.600 --> 29:03.920
so,

29:04.260 --> 29:06.220
this is like entertainment,

29:06.900 --> 29:08.440
but anyway,

29:08.620 --> 29:10.260
passwords are a pain.

29:10.260 --> 29:12.120
So we're going to focus

29:12.120 --> 29:12.640
for a moment

29:12.640 --> 29:13.300
on the passwords.

29:15.960 --> 29:16.680
There have been

29:16.680 --> 29:17.520
tons of breaches

29:17.520 --> 29:17.900
in the middle,

29:17.940 --> 29:18.340
but by the way,

29:18.360 --> 29:19.080
this is super old.

29:19.200 --> 29:19.880
All these examples

29:19.880 --> 29:20.480
are super old,

29:20.620 --> 29:20.980
and yet,

29:21.660 --> 29:22.560
I don't refresh them.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.060
They're like 20 years old.

29:25.420 --> 29:25.640
But,

29:25.880 --> 29:27.100
this happens every year.

29:28.540 --> 29:29.700
The similar things

29:29.700 --> 29:30.500
that happened

29:30.500 --> 29:30.820
20,

29:30.880 --> 29:31.700
25 years ago

29:31.700 --> 29:32.360
still happen.

29:33.900 --> 29:34.040
Right?

29:34.040 --> 29:38.860
If you go to the

29:38.860 --> 29:39.920
website,

29:40.040 --> 29:41.020
passwordpresearch.com,

29:41.080 --> 29:41.620
they have lots

29:41.620 --> 29:42.080
of interesting

29:42.080 --> 29:42.420
articles.

29:45.000 --> 29:45.280
Right?

29:45.440 --> 29:45.620
So,

29:45.780 --> 29:46.660
why do people

29:46.660 --> 29:47.300
want your password?

29:47.500 --> 29:47.780
So,

29:47.880 --> 29:48.160
of course,

29:48.420 --> 29:49.000
one of the reasons

29:49.000 --> 29:49.940
they may want your password

29:49.940 --> 29:51.800
is just to log in

29:51.800 --> 29:52.820
and just delete your files.

29:52.940 --> 29:53.640
They just hate you

29:53.640 --> 29:54.460
and they want to

29:54.460 --> 29:54.820
suck.

29:55.820 --> 29:56.600
That doesn't happen

29:56.600 --> 29:57.020
very often.

29:58.220 --> 29:58.720
It can.

29:58.940 --> 29:59.220
I mean,

29:59.820 --> 30:00.700
you make some enemies,

30:00.940 --> 30:01.560
you probably can.

30:01.560 --> 30:02.000
But,

30:02.000 --> 30:02.780
this is very personal.

30:03.920 --> 30:04.320
Generally,

30:05.440 --> 30:06.120
what somebody wants

30:06.120 --> 30:06.860
is more than just

30:06.860 --> 30:07.260
your password.

30:07.520 --> 30:07.640
So,

30:08.720 --> 30:10.220
installing a key log

30:10.220 --> 30:10.760
or a sniffer

30:10.760 --> 30:12.420
is another way.

30:12.980 --> 30:13.600
And then,

30:13.840 --> 30:14.360
basically,

30:14.920 --> 30:16.220
you sniff for more passwords.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.520
Especially if your account,

30:18.920 --> 30:19.740
getting into your account,

30:19.820 --> 30:20.300
is privileged.

30:20.480 --> 30:20.600
Right?

30:20.660 --> 30:20.780
So,

30:20.880 --> 30:21.680
maybe it will be able

30:21.680 --> 30:22.840
to run a sniffer

30:22.840 --> 30:23.460
that will sniff

30:23.460 --> 30:24.420
on other people's passwords.

30:25.580 --> 30:26.420
The other thing

30:26.420 --> 30:27.660
is to steal the password file.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.000
And once you steal

30:30.000 --> 30:30.800
the password file,

30:30.880 --> 30:31.020
well,

30:31.020 --> 30:31.720
then you can run

30:31.720 --> 30:34.860
password cracking too much.

30:35.640 --> 30:36.860
Because the password file,

30:36.960 --> 30:37.820
as you can already imagine,

30:38.020 --> 30:38.860
doesn't actually store

30:38.860 --> 30:39.540
a real password,

30:39.680 --> 30:40.480
but stores hashes.

30:41.580 --> 30:41.800
Right?

30:41.860 --> 30:41.980
So,

30:42.060 --> 30:42.680
all you need to do

30:42.680 --> 30:43.740
is try a brute force adapt.

30:51.620 --> 30:52.060
Alright?

30:52.160 --> 30:52.420
So,

30:52.640 --> 30:53.820
Unix-style passwords

30:53.820 --> 30:54.460
work like this,

30:54.520 --> 30:54.680
right?

30:54.740 --> 30:55.920
You enter your password,

30:56.240 --> 30:56.940
it hashes,

30:57.080 --> 30:57.760
and then this is

30:57.760 --> 30:58.300
the etc.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.780
etc. password file

30:59.780 --> 31:01.040
that has one line

31:01.040 --> 31:01.580
for a user,

31:01.740 --> 31:02.060
generally,

31:02.800 --> 31:04.020
and it contains,

31:04.160 --> 31:04.860
among other things,

31:05.000 --> 31:05.480
so the line,

31:05.680 --> 31:07.000
the one line is like,

31:07.000 --> 31:07.660
it's a text file.

31:08.060 --> 31:08.200
So,

31:08.280 --> 31:09.540
one line for a record,

31:09.880 --> 31:10.060
oh,

31:10.180 --> 31:11.440
one line is a record,

31:11.580 --> 31:12.140
and this record

31:12.140 --> 31:13.180
is for a given user,

31:13.680 --> 31:14.440
and it has some

31:14.440 --> 31:15.600
non-human accounts,

31:16.680 --> 31:16.980
okay?

31:16.980 --> 31:18.340
net, like root,

31:18.460 --> 31:19.740
and admin,

31:19.860 --> 31:20.200
or whatever,

31:20.400 --> 31:20.780
some other,

31:20.860 --> 31:22.020
some other cron account,

31:22.340 --> 31:23.540
but it also has one

31:23.540 --> 31:24.220
for every user.

31:24.660 --> 31:25.020
And so,

31:26.080 --> 31:27.020
when you enter a username,

31:27.540 --> 31:28.420
the username is also

31:28.420 --> 31:29.340
stored there in the clear.

31:32.840 --> 31:33.240
So,

31:33.840 --> 31:35.140
people realized early on

31:35.140 --> 31:36.260
that it's not a good idea

31:36.260 --> 31:38.040
to store a password there,

31:38.160 --> 31:39.340
so why don't we store a hash?

31:40.320 --> 31:40.680
So,

31:40.900 --> 31:41.320
great,

31:42.400 --> 31:43.360
the system doesn't know

31:43.360 --> 31:43.960
your password,

31:44.840 --> 31:45.880
it only knows the hash,

31:46.880 --> 31:47.680
and because,

31:48.320 --> 31:48.680
presumably,

31:48.780 --> 31:50.100
we use a good cryptographic hash,

31:50.180 --> 31:52.020
like the kind we talked about

31:52.020 --> 31:53.120
briefly last time,

31:54.540 --> 31:55.680
hash is supposed to be

31:55.680 --> 31:56.560
one way.

31:58.580 --> 31:58.820
Yeah?

31:59.800 --> 32:01.300
One way means that,

32:01.300 --> 32:01.940
yeah,

32:02.140 --> 32:02.820
the inverting,

32:02.940 --> 32:03.880
like knowing a hash,

32:04.220 --> 32:05.440
and learning what the input

32:05.440 --> 32:06.340
to the hash was,

32:07.000 --> 32:07.540
is hard.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.300
But is it really?

32:11.920 --> 32:13.040
If the input space

32:13.040 --> 32:13.840
is very large,

32:14.060 --> 32:14.640
it is hard.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.240
But if the input space

32:17.240 --> 32:18.360
is constricted,

32:19.380 --> 32:20.200
it might not be so hard.

32:20.480 --> 32:20.980
But wait,

32:21.060 --> 32:21.560
there's more.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.020
Hashing is better

32:25.020 --> 32:25.560
than encryption,

32:25.760 --> 32:26.900
maybe you will realize why.

32:27.380 --> 32:27.840
You know why?

32:32.780 --> 32:33.520
I mean,

32:35.640 --> 32:36.760
encrypting a block,

32:38.040 --> 32:38.740
it should be,

32:38.960 --> 32:40.280
it's usually roughly equivalent

32:40.280 --> 32:41.180
to hashing a block.

32:41.180 --> 32:43.360
All you think encryption

32:43.360 --> 32:45.540
is not used.

32:46.540 --> 32:47.460
And hashing is used.

32:48.980 --> 32:50.100
No decryption.

32:50.860 --> 32:51.680
No decryption.

32:53.300 --> 32:53.940
Yeah,

32:54.120 --> 32:54.960
that's a reason,

32:55.100 --> 32:55.640
it's not that.

32:55.980 --> 32:56.640
Major reason.

32:57.380 --> 32:58.200
I hope you've never

32:58.200 --> 32:59.300
had to see the thing

32:59.300 --> 33:00.100
that's passed through

33:00.100 --> 33:01.200
and that's been honest.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.300
Okay,

33:02.360 --> 33:03.140
now you're getting close.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.460
What else does encryption

33:05.460 --> 33:06.420
mean?

33:07.580 --> 33:08.880
You want to encrypt the question.

33:13.620 --> 33:14.040
No,

33:14.220 --> 33:15.060
it leaks the length,

33:15.160 --> 33:15.520
doesn't it?

33:15.940 --> 33:16.160
Hmm.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.460
So you want to have

33:18.460 --> 33:19.220
the uniform

33:19.220 --> 33:21.320
value,

33:21.580 --> 33:21.860
right?

33:22.500 --> 33:23.380
There are other reasons,

33:23.460 --> 33:24.300
then you can think of some.

33:25.000 --> 33:25.820
Encryption is not,

33:25.980 --> 33:26.640
now encryption,

33:26.800 --> 33:27.000
that's,

33:27.380 --> 33:28.080
let me rephrase

33:28.080 --> 33:28.520
what I said,

33:28.600 --> 33:29.120
be very careful.

33:31.500 --> 33:32.500
Encryption as in

33:32.500 --> 33:34.380
something that can be reversed

33:34.380 --> 33:35.520
is not used.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.820
You can use encryption

33:37.820 --> 33:38.820
to build a hash function.

33:39.000 --> 33:39.840
An encryption function

33:39.840 --> 33:40.460
can be used

33:40.460 --> 33:41.260
to build a hash function.

33:42.960 --> 33:43.320
Okay,

33:43.500 --> 33:44.100
so it's okay

33:44.100 --> 33:45.320
to use encryption function

33:45.320 --> 33:46.420
to build a hash function

33:46.420 --> 33:47.080
that you can use

33:47.080 --> 33:47.660
for this purpose.

33:48.040 --> 33:48.900
But what we don't do

33:48.900 --> 33:49.760
is encrypt

33:49.760 --> 33:50.880
the password itself.

33:51.880 --> 33:52.120
Okay?

33:52.120 --> 33:56.100
So remember the

33:56.100 --> 33:58.220
properties of hash functions,

33:58.360 --> 33:58.520
right?

33:58.600 --> 34:00.240
So if you are a password hacker

34:00.240 --> 34:02.120
and you want to

34:02.120 --> 34:03.060
break the password,

34:03.480 --> 34:04.180
what property

34:04.180 --> 34:04.740
would you like

34:04.740 --> 34:05.540
the hash function

34:05.540 --> 34:06.280
not to have?

34:09.660 --> 34:10.140
Well,

34:10.140 --> 34:11.580
one way is we agree.

34:11.700 --> 34:12.540
We all must have,

34:12.600 --> 34:12.740
right?

34:12.740 --> 34:13.740
Because it should be

34:13.740 --> 34:14.720
difficult to go back

34:14.720 --> 34:15.820
and figure out

34:15.820 --> 34:16.460
from the hash

34:16.460 --> 34:17.080
what the password

34:17.080 --> 34:17.500
is going to be.

34:18.080 --> 34:18.960
But what about

34:18.960 --> 34:19.560
these other things?

34:19.680 --> 34:20.040
Remember,

34:20.160 --> 34:20.700
there's a strong

34:20.700 --> 34:21.720
collision resistance

34:21.720 --> 34:23.640
and weak collision resistance.

34:25.200 --> 34:26.360
Which do we care

34:26.360 --> 34:27.040
about?

34:28.900 --> 34:29.460
Yeah.

34:29.840 --> 34:30.340
Strong

34:30.340 --> 34:31.820
would be nice to have

34:31.820 --> 34:33.560
but not super important

34:33.560 --> 34:35.200
because

34:35.200 --> 34:37.020
the password

34:37.020 --> 34:38.000
is specific,

34:38.120 --> 34:38.240
right?

34:38.280 --> 34:38.720
It's given.

34:39.980 --> 34:40.860
It's given

34:40.860 --> 34:42.440
to the hacker

34:42.440 --> 34:43.860
but it's fixed

34:43.860 --> 34:44.480
by the hash,

34:44.840 --> 34:45.100
right?

34:45.720 --> 34:46.420
So in order

34:46.420 --> 34:47.480
to break

34:47.480 --> 34:48.220
the system

34:48.220 --> 34:48.800
without learning

34:48.800 --> 34:49.360
the password,

34:49.360 --> 34:50.920
the hacker

34:50.920 --> 34:51.640
has to find

34:51.640 --> 34:52.760
another password

34:52.760 --> 34:54.280
that hashes

34:54.280 --> 34:55.320
into the same value.

34:56.720 --> 34:57.240
Does that make sense?

34:58.520 --> 34:59.700
So if your password

34:59.700 --> 35:00.360
is Apple

35:00.360 --> 35:01.660
and it hashes

35:01.660 --> 35:01.920
into

35:01.920 --> 35:03.620
345

35:03.620 --> 35:05.800
and I pick

35:05.800 --> 35:07.100
Pear

35:07.100 --> 35:07.940
and it also

35:07.940 --> 35:08.480
hashes into

35:08.480 --> 35:09.020
the 345

35:09.020 --> 35:09.760
I don't need

35:09.760 --> 35:10.060
to know

35:10.060 --> 35:10.520
Apple.

35:12.200 --> 35:12.960
I can just

35:12.960 --> 35:13.620
log into your account

35:13.620 --> 35:14.460
by typing Pear.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.380
OK?

35:17.440 --> 35:17.880
So

35:17.880 --> 35:19.520
that weak collision

35:19.520 --> 35:19.860
resistance

35:19.860 --> 35:20.760
and that's

35:20.760 --> 35:21.200
what we need.

35:27.000 --> 35:27.480
So

35:27.480 --> 35:29.140
I'm not sure

35:29.140 --> 35:29.380
how many

35:29.380 --> 35:30.020
to do it

35:30.020 --> 35:30.680
but historically

35:30.680 --> 35:31.160
that's what

35:31.160 --> 35:31.660
has been done

35:31.660 --> 35:32.740
is that

35:32.740 --> 35:34.320
Linux

35:34.320 --> 35:35.040
was using

35:35.040 --> 35:35.520
DES

35:35.520 --> 35:37.940
encryption

35:37.940 --> 35:39.420
as a hash

35:39.420 --> 35:39.700
function.

35:39.700 --> 35:40.760
Now how

35:40.760 --> 35:41.420
does it do it?

35:41.680 --> 35:41.960
Well,

35:42.080 --> 35:42.460
it takes

35:42.460 --> 35:43.100
a null

35:43.100 --> 35:43.580
string

35:43.580 --> 35:45.580
a 64-bit

35:45.580 --> 35:46.620
now you remember

35:46.620 --> 35:48.360
DES is a 64-bit block

35:48.360 --> 35:49.320
so it takes

35:49.320 --> 35:50.380
a string of

35:50.380 --> 35:50.620
0

35:50.620 --> 35:51.500
64-bits

35:51.500 --> 35:51.840
long

35:51.840 --> 35:52.780
and then

35:52.780 --> 35:53.780
encrypts it

35:53.780 --> 35:54.400
repeatedly

35:54.400 --> 35:55.120
OK?

35:55.560 --> 35:56.180
Repeatedly

35:56.180 --> 35:57.160
25 times

35:57.160 --> 35:58.800
using

35:58.800 --> 35:59.880
a DES

35:59.880 --> 36:00.240
key

36:00.240 --> 36:00.900
that is

36:00.900 --> 36:01.260
derived

36:01.260 --> 36:01.560
from the

36:01.560 --> 36:01.880
password.

36:03.980 --> 36:04.220
OK?

36:05.700 --> 36:06.260
Make sense?

36:06.260 --> 36:07.920
So it converts

36:07.920 --> 36:08.460
your password

36:08.460 --> 36:09.320
into a key

36:09.320 --> 36:10.720
now that's

36:10.720 --> 36:11.080
also

36:11.080 --> 36:12.060
an interesting

36:12.060 --> 36:12.380
detail

36:12.380 --> 36:12.820
because

36:12.820 --> 36:13.820
DES keys

36:13.820 --> 36:14.280
are actually

36:14.280 --> 36:15.180
56-bits

36:15.180 --> 36:15.560
long

36:15.560 --> 36:16.560
I mean

36:16.560 --> 36:17.180
they're 64

36:17.180 --> 36:17.860
but 8-bits

36:17.860 --> 36:18.680
are parity-bits

36:18.680 --> 36:19.460
so

36:19.460 --> 36:21.500
that's an

36:21.500 --> 36:22.140
interesting one

36:22.140 --> 36:24.100
so we'll come

36:24.100 --> 36:24.560
back to that

36:24.560 --> 36:25.100
in a second.

36:25.720 --> 36:26.140
The idea

36:26.140 --> 36:26.720
so why do

36:26.720 --> 36:27.380
they do this

36:27.380 --> 36:28.200
or why did

36:28.200 --> 36:28.840
they do this

36:28.840 --> 36:30.180
because in

36:30.180 --> 36:30.640
order to

36:30.640 --> 36:31.460
mount a

36:31.460 --> 36:33.960
brute force

36:33.960 --> 36:34.340
attack

36:34.340 --> 36:34.980
on a password

36:34.980 --> 36:36.360
you would

36:36.360 --> 36:36.680
have to

36:36.680 --> 36:37.060
guess the

36:37.060 --> 36:37.520
password

36:37.520 --> 36:39.280
and perform

36:39.280 --> 36:41.460
25

36:41.460 --> 36:42.480
encryptions

36:42.480 --> 36:44.720
or

36:44.720 --> 36:45.380
if you like

36:45.380 --> 36:45.840
25

36:45.840 --> 36:46.300
decryptions

36:46.300 --> 36:47.700
and at

36:47.700 --> 36:48.160
the end

36:48.160 --> 36:49.800
OK?

36:51.480 --> 36:51.840
If you

36:51.840 --> 36:52.420
hit 0

36:52.420 --> 36:53.580
if what

36:53.580 --> 36:54.120
you decrypt

36:54.120 --> 36:54.920
after 25

36:54.920 --> 36:55.480
decryptions

36:55.480 --> 36:55.940
and 0

36:55.940 --> 36:56.280
and a

36:56.280 --> 36:56.620
string of

36:56.620 --> 36:56.960
0s

36:56.960 --> 36:57.520
you guessed

36:57.520 --> 36:57.960
correctly.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.400
OK?

37:02.140 --> 37:02.600
Or

37:02.600 --> 37:03.240
alternatively

37:03.240 --> 37:03.540
you would

37:03.540 --> 37:03.820
take

37:03.820 --> 37:04.400
a string

37:04.400 --> 37:04.960
of 0s

37:04.960 --> 37:06.080
and encrypt

37:06.080 --> 37:06.600
it 25

37:06.600 --> 37:07.060
times

37:07.060 --> 37:07.760
and see

37:07.760 --> 37:08.100
if that

37:08.100 --> 37:08.460
matches

37:08.460 --> 37:09.020
the result

37:09.020 --> 37:09.300
in the

37:09.300 --> 37:09.600
password

37:09.600 --> 37:09.940
file.

37:11.380 --> 37:11.660
Am I

37:11.660 --> 37:12.000
with you?

37:12.720 --> 37:12.960
Any

37:12.960 --> 37:13.260
questions?

37:15.100 --> 37:15.620
So

37:15.620 --> 37:16.100
it's a

37:16.100 --> 37:16.660
clever idea

37:16.660 --> 37:16.900
right?

37:16.960 --> 37:17.260
The idea

37:17.260 --> 37:17.640
was to

37:17.640 --> 37:18.220
slow down

37:18.220 --> 37:18.380
the

37:18.380 --> 37:18.680
attacker

37:18.680 --> 37:19.320
25

37:19.320 --> 37:20.120
that is

37:20.120 --> 37:20.620
for every

37:20.620 --> 37:21.100
guess

37:21.100 --> 37:22.700
of a

37:22.700 --> 37:23.060
password

37:23.060 --> 37:23.780
or every

37:23.780 --> 37:24.880
possible

37:24.880 --> 37:25.280
password

37:25.280 --> 37:25.680
the attacker

37:25.680 --> 37:26.040
guesses

37:26.040 --> 37:27.240
it would

37:27.240 --> 37:27.540
have to

37:27.540 --> 37:28.120
perform

37:28.120 --> 37:29.280
25

37:29.280 --> 37:30.320
encryption

37:30.320 --> 37:30.980
or decryption

37:30.980 --> 37:31.460
operations.

37:31.460 --> 37:34.460
that's

37:34.460 --> 37:34.820
a lot

37:34.820 --> 37:35.940
and back

37:35.940 --> 37:36.380
then

37:36.380 --> 37:37.400
DESC was

37:37.400 --> 37:37.820
implemented

37:37.820 --> 37:38.300
mostly in

37:38.300 --> 37:38.620
hardware

37:38.620 --> 37:38.900
it was

37:38.900 --> 37:39.320
very slow

37:39.320 --> 37:39.800
in software

37:39.800 --> 37:40.680
so it

37:40.680 --> 37:41.180
seemed like

37:41.180 --> 37:41.700
a good idea.

37:42.300 --> 37:42.680
And then

37:42.680 --> 37:43.380
of course

37:43.380 --> 37:44.360
passwords aren't

37:44.360 --> 37:45.020
really random

37:45.020 --> 37:45.380
right?

37:46.820 --> 37:47.700
Doesn't matter

37:47.700 --> 37:49.080
how old you

37:49.080 --> 37:49.580
are, doesn't

37:49.580 --> 37:50.040
matter what

37:50.040 --> 37:50.620
culture

37:50.620 --> 37:51.140
or which

37:51.140 --> 37:51.600
country

37:51.600 --> 37:52.040
which

37:52.040 --> 37:52.940
ethnicity

37:52.940 --> 37:53.560
you come

37:53.560 --> 37:53.920
from

37:53.920 --> 37:55.040
within the

37:55.040 --> 37:55.540
group that

37:55.540 --> 37:55.960
you come

37:55.960 --> 37:56.240
from

37:56.240 --> 37:57.280
you're

37:57.280 --> 37:57.900
likely to

37:57.900 --> 37:58.300
pick a

37:58.300 --> 37:58.680
password

37:58.680 --> 38:00.000
that is

38:00.000 --> 38:00.280
not

38:00.280 --> 38:00.520
truly

38:00.520 --> 38:00.920
random.

38:01.960 --> 38:02.280
There's

38:02.280 --> 38:02.680
no such

38:02.680 --> 38:03.100
thing as

38:03.100 --> 38:03.460
humans

38:03.460 --> 38:03.780
picking

38:03.780 --> 38:04.540
truly

38:04.540 --> 38:04.920
random

38:04.920 --> 38:05.300
passwords.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.140
Even if

38:06.140 --> 38:06.460
you say

38:06.460 --> 38:06.780
well

38:06.780 --> 38:07.660
I know

38:07.660 --> 38:09.480
a certain

38:09.480 --> 38:09.940
date

38:09.940 --> 38:10.780
where

38:10.780 --> 38:11.100
let's

38:11.100 --> 38:11.440
say

38:11.440 --> 38:12.700
I

38:12.700 --> 38:12.800
don't

38:12.800 --> 38:13.060
know

38:13.060 --> 38:15.140
I

38:15.140 --> 38:15.660
graduated

38:15.660 --> 38:16.040
from

38:16.040 --> 38:16.520
college

38:16.520 --> 38:16.960
or

38:16.960 --> 38:17.440
I

38:17.440 --> 38:18.020
had

38:18.020 --> 38:18.180
my

38:18.180 --> 38:18.480
first

38:18.480 --> 38:18.980
date

38:18.980 --> 38:19.380
or

38:19.380 --> 38:20.880
something

38:20.880 --> 38:21.760
auspicious

38:21.760 --> 38:22.260
happened

38:22.260 --> 38:22.520
on a

38:22.520 --> 38:22.840
particular

38:22.840 --> 38:23.140
date

38:23.140 --> 38:24.080
and

38:24.080 --> 38:24.400
nobody

38:24.400 --> 38:24.620
else

38:24.620 --> 38:24.860
knows

38:24.860 --> 38:25.080
it

38:25.080 --> 38:25.700
just

38:25.700 --> 38:25.980
you

38:25.980 --> 38:27.120
you

38:27.120 --> 38:27.340
think

38:27.340 --> 38:27.560
that

38:27.560 --> 38:27.760
might

38:27.760 --> 38:27.900
be

38:27.900 --> 38:28.220
random

38:28.220 --> 38:28.440
but

38:28.440 --> 38:28.700
actually

38:28.700 --> 38:28.880
it's

38:28.880 --> 38:29.140
not.

38:31.460 --> 38:31.640
I

38:31.640 --> 38:31.880
think

38:31.880 --> 38:32.080
about

38:32.080 --> 38:32.560
are

38:32.560 --> 38:32.860
dates

38:32.860 --> 38:33.140
really

38:33.140 --> 38:33.480
random?

38:34.460 --> 38:34.680
There's

38:34.680 --> 38:34.880
a lot

38:34.880 --> 38:34.980
of

38:34.980 --> 38:35.160
people

38:35.160 --> 38:35.420
use

38:35.420 --> 38:35.580
them

38:35.580 --> 38:36.040
professionally.

38:37.480 --> 38:37.720
Think

38:37.720 --> 38:37.900
about

38:37.900 --> 38:38.100
how

38:38.100 --> 38:38.260
we

38:38.260 --> 38:38.600
structure

38:38.600 --> 38:39.020
dates.

38:41.220 --> 38:41.580
Forget

38:41.580 --> 38:42.200
hours

38:42.200 --> 38:42.380
a

38:42.380 --> 38:42.520
minute

38:42.520 --> 38:42.780
just

38:42.780 --> 38:43.120
dates.

38:44.580 --> 38:44.740
I

38:44.740 --> 38:44.860
mean

38:44.860 --> 38:45.180
depending

38:45.180 --> 38:45.340
on

38:45.340 --> 38:46.200
which

38:46.200 --> 38:46.600
notation

38:46.600 --> 38:46.780
it

38:46.780 --> 38:47.020
used

38:47.020 --> 38:47.140
to

38:47.140 --> 38:47.280
them

38:47.280 --> 38:47.400
in

38:47.400 --> 38:47.500
the

38:47.500 --> 38:47.700
United

38:47.700 --> 38:48.040
States

38:48.040 --> 38:48.220
we

38:48.220 --> 38:48.460
use

38:48.460 --> 38:49.280
month

38:49.280 --> 38:49.860
day

38:49.860 --> 38:50.440
year

38:50.440 --> 38:50.940
right?

38:52.400 --> 38:52.680
How

38:52.680 --> 38:52.860
many

38:52.860 --> 38:53.140
months

38:53.140 --> 38:53.280
are

38:53.280 --> 38:53.500
there?

38:54.720 --> 38:55.180
Well

38:55.180 --> 38:56.000
last time I

38:56.000 --> 38:56.220
said

38:56.220 --> 38:58.220
how many

38:58.220 --> 38:58.680
days are

38:58.680 --> 38:58.880
there?

38:59.080 --> 38:59.480
Let's be

38:59.480 --> 39:00.100
generous and

39:00.100 --> 39:00.700
say 51

39:00.700 --> 39:01.100
in every

39:01.100 --> 39:01.380
month

39:01.380 --> 39:01.700
right?

39:02.440 --> 39:02.720
They're

39:02.720 --> 39:02.980
honest

39:02.980 --> 39:03.300
right?

39:03.520 --> 39:04.160
Let's say

39:04.160 --> 39:04.400
they're

39:04.400 --> 39:04.720
out because

39:04.720 --> 39:05.020
they're

39:05.020 --> 39:05.540
the maximum

39:05.540 --> 39:06.760
and how many

39:06.760 --> 39:07.280
years is it?

39:07.380 --> 39:07.700
Well

39:07.700 --> 39:08.140
there are a lot

39:08.140 --> 39:08.580
of years

39:08.580 --> 39:09.940
but you're not

39:09.940 --> 39:10.800
likely to pick

39:10.800 --> 39:11.580
a year from

39:11.580 --> 39:13.040
dark ages

39:13.040 --> 39:14.280
history

39:14.280 --> 39:14.300
history

39:14.300 --> 39:15.680
and

39:15.680 --> 39:16.360
yeah

39:16.360 --> 39:17.240
if you're

39:17.240 --> 39:17.560
a fan

39:17.560 --> 39:17.920
of history

39:17.920 --> 39:18.320
you might

39:18.320 --> 39:18.560
pick

39:18.560 --> 39:18.880
something

39:18.880 --> 39:22.460
ancient

39:22.460 --> 39:22.900
Egyptian

39:22.900 --> 39:23.280
era

39:23.280 --> 39:23.580
or

39:23.580 --> 39:24.340
something

39:24.340 --> 39:24.800
from

39:24.800 --> 39:25.620
the

39:25.620 --> 39:25.880
time

39:25.880 --> 39:26.120
of

39:26.120 --> 39:27.020
William

39:27.020 --> 39:27.200
the

39:27.200 --> 39:27.700
Conqueror

39:27.700 --> 39:27.960
but

39:27.960 --> 39:28.980
most of

39:28.980 --> 39:29.120
us

39:29.120 --> 39:29.400
would pick

39:29.400 --> 39:29.680
something

39:29.680 --> 39:30.080
reasonably

39:30.080 --> 39:30.420
more

39:30.420 --> 39:31.060
1940

39:31.060 --> 39:31.720
21st

39:31.720 --> 39:32.020
century

39:32.020 --> 39:32.420
so

39:32.420 --> 39:32.600
that

39:32.600 --> 39:32.920
does not

39:32.920 --> 39:33.100
be

39:33.100 --> 39:33.400
vulnerable

39:33.400 --> 39:34.280
that's

39:34.280 --> 39:34.540
not

39:34.540 --> 39:35.000
random

39:35.000 --> 39:36.740
and the

39:36.740 --> 39:37.100
space

39:37.100 --> 39:37.380
of that

39:37.380 --> 39:37.500
is

39:37.500 --> 39:37.740
very

39:37.740 --> 39:38.100
small

39:38.100 --> 39:39.640
so

39:39.640 --> 39:39.820
don't

39:39.820 --> 39:39.980
pick

39:39.980 --> 39:40.260
dates

39:40.260 --> 39:41.020
in any

39:41.020 --> 39:41.340
format

39:41.340 --> 39:43.720
right

39:43.720 --> 39:43.920
so

39:43.920 --> 39:44.160
but if

39:44.160 --> 39:44.440
you just

39:44.440 --> 39:44.780
look at

39:44.780 --> 39:45.000
the

39:45.000 --> 39:45.860
52

39:45.860 --> 39:46.380
upper

39:46.380 --> 39:46.560
and

39:46.560 --> 39:46.840
lower

39:46.840 --> 39:47.220
case

39:47.220 --> 39:47.820
letters

39:47.820 --> 39:49.440
that is

39:49.440 --> 39:49.640
being

39:49.640 --> 39:50.040
generous

39:50.040 --> 39:50.440
assuming

39:50.440 --> 39:50.740
that

39:50.740 --> 39:51.120
whatever

39:51.120 --> 39:51.520
system

39:51.520 --> 39:51.720
we're

39:51.720 --> 39:51.960
working

39:51.960 --> 39:52.800
distinguishes

39:52.800 --> 39:53.160
between

39:53.160 --> 39:53.440
upper

39:53.440 --> 39:53.600
and

39:53.600 --> 39:53.740
lower

39:53.740 --> 39:53.900
case

39:53.900 --> 39:54.160
because

39:54.160 --> 39:54.540
some

39:54.540 --> 39:55.620
systems

39:55.620 --> 39:55.860
do

39:55.860 --> 39:56.120
not

39:56.120 --> 39:56.600
right

39:56.600 --> 39:57.520
they'll

39:57.520 --> 39:57.760
just

39:57.760 --> 39:58.420
convert

39:58.420 --> 39:58.800
everything

39:58.800 --> 39:59.000
to

39:59.000 --> 39:59.180
upper

39:59.180 --> 39:59.500
case

39:59.500 --> 39:59.680
or

39:59.680 --> 40:00.000
lower

40:00.000 --> 40:00.200
case

40:00.200 --> 40:00.840
so

40:00.840 --> 40:01.520
52

40:01.520 --> 40:02.420
in English

40:02.420 --> 40:02.740
20

40:02.740 --> 40:03.040
that's

40:03.040 --> 40:03.620
26

40:03.620 --> 40:04.460
26 times

40:04.460 --> 40:04.680
2

40:04.680 --> 40:04.920
plus

40:04.920 --> 40:05.160
10

40:05.160 --> 40:05.620
digits

40:05.620 --> 40:07.080
and

40:07.080 --> 40:07.480
32

40:07.480 --> 40:08.160
punctuation

40:08.160 --> 40:08.560
symbols

40:08.560 --> 40:09.120
although

40:09.120 --> 40:10.860
many

40:10.860 --> 40:11.700
password

40:11.700 --> 40:12.760
rules

40:12.760 --> 40:13.180
will not

40:13.180 --> 40:13.540
allow you

40:13.540 --> 40:13.780
to use

40:13.780 --> 40:14.260
punctuation

40:14.260 --> 40:15.600
they might

40:15.600 --> 40:16.000
allow you

40:16.000 --> 40:16.400
to use

40:16.400 --> 40:16.700
like

40:16.700 --> 40:18.100
exclamation

40:18.100 --> 40:18.660
point

40:18.660 --> 40:19.280
the question

40:19.280 --> 40:19.800
mark

40:19.800 --> 40:20.620
the dot

40:20.620 --> 40:21.020
and maybe

40:21.020 --> 40:21.760
that's it

40:21.760 --> 40:22.820
but okay

40:22.820 --> 40:23.200
let's be

40:23.200 --> 40:23.560
generous

40:23.560 --> 40:24.840
so that

40:24.840 --> 40:25.300
gives us

40:25.300 --> 40:25.740
52

40:25.740 --> 40:26.340
plus 10

40:26.340 --> 40:27.040
plus 32

40:27.040 --> 40:28.500
that's

40:28.500 --> 40:28.980
94

40:28.980 --> 40:31.180
and let's

40:31.180 --> 40:31.560
say we

40:31.560 --> 40:32.040
limit to

40:32.040 --> 40:32.720
8 characters

40:32.720 --> 40:34.600
because

40:34.600 --> 40:36.720
that's

40:36.720 --> 40:37.200
pretty much

40:37.200 --> 40:37.880
how many

40:37.880 --> 40:38.120
of you

40:38.120 --> 40:38.300
have

40:38.300 --> 40:38.760
passwords

40:38.760 --> 40:39.200
that I

40:39.200 --> 40:39.560
exceed

40:39.560 --> 40:40.220
8 characters

40:40.220 --> 40:42.940
yeah

40:42.940 --> 40:43.880
I buy

40:43.880 --> 40:44.240
a lot

40:44.240 --> 40:45.060
how many

40:45.060 --> 40:45.580
exceed

40:45.580 --> 40:46.340
12 characters

40:46.340 --> 40:48.520
look at

40:48.520 --> 40:48.720
you

40:48.720 --> 40:49.500
15

40:49.500 --> 40:53.780
okay

40:53.780 --> 40:54.260
you like

40:54.260 --> 40:54.560
entering

40:54.560 --> 40:55.000
passwords

40:55.000 --> 40:55.420
don't you

40:55.420 --> 40:56.400
because

40:56.400 --> 40:56.760
there's

40:56.760 --> 40:57.060
a big

40:57.060 --> 40:57.460
trade-off

40:57.460 --> 40:57.700
here

40:57.700 --> 40:58.000
right

40:58.000 --> 40:59.020
the big

40:59.020 --> 40:59.520
trade-off

40:59.520 --> 40:59.920
is

40:59.920 --> 41:00.840
okay

41:00.840 --> 41:01.100
so

41:01.100 --> 41:01.360
let's

41:01.360 --> 41:01.500
say

41:01.500 --> 41:03.180
I'm

41:03.180 --> 41:03.440
not going

41:03.440 --> 41:04.080
to

41:04.080 --> 41:04.720
triangulate

41:04.720 --> 41:04.920
your

41:04.920 --> 41:05.220
password

41:05.220 --> 41:05.500
here

41:05.500 --> 41:06.840
but let's

41:06.840 --> 41:07.100
say you

41:07.100 --> 41:07.240
have

41:07.240 --> 41:07.560
15

41:07.560 --> 41:07.900
character

41:07.900 --> 41:08.360
password

41:08.360 --> 41:09.300
and

41:09.300 --> 41:10.520
he has

41:10.520 --> 41:10.900
an 8

41:10.900 --> 41:11.340
character

41:11.340 --> 41:11.760
password

41:11.760 --> 41:12.900
now we

41:12.900 --> 41:13.020
have

41:13.020 --> 41:13.600
usability

41:13.600 --> 41:14.120
issue

41:14.120 --> 41:15.620
let's

41:15.620 --> 41:15.820
say

41:15.820 --> 41:16.100
you're

41:16.100 --> 41:16.500
young

41:16.500 --> 41:17.040
you're

41:17.040 --> 41:17.380
smart

41:17.380 --> 41:17.720
you can

41:17.720 --> 41:18.120
remember

41:18.120 --> 41:18.500
15

41:18.500 --> 41:18.820
characters

41:18.820 --> 41:19.380
obviously

41:19.380 --> 41:19.820
you can

41:19.820 --> 41:20.060
right

41:20.060 --> 41:23.300
but what

41:23.300 --> 41:23.480
about

41:23.480 --> 41:23.780
making

41:23.780 --> 41:24.420
mistakes

41:24.420 --> 41:25.580
in

41:25.580 --> 41:25.740
those

41:25.740 --> 41:26.020
15

41:26.020 --> 41:26.440
characters

41:26.440 --> 41:26.780
as you

41:26.780 --> 41:27.060
type

41:27.060 --> 41:28.900
have

41:28.900 --> 41:29.020
we

41:29.020 --> 41:29.220
never

41:29.220 --> 41:29.420
did

41:29.420 --> 41:29.840
mistakes

41:29.840 --> 41:33.840
right

41:33.840 --> 41:34.580
how likely

41:34.580 --> 41:34.980
let's

41:34.980 --> 41:35.380
put it

41:35.380 --> 41:35.720
another way

41:35.720 --> 41:36.260
how likely

41:36.260 --> 41:36.440
are you

41:36.440 --> 41:36.700
to make

41:36.700 --> 41:37.100
a mistake

41:37.100 --> 41:37.380
in an

41:37.380 --> 41:37.540
8

41:37.540 --> 41:37.880
character

41:37.880 --> 41:38.280
password

41:38.280 --> 41:38.760
as opposed

41:38.760 --> 41:38.980
to a

41:38.980 --> 41:39.220
15

41:39.220 --> 41:39.580
character

41:39.580 --> 41:39.960
password

41:39.960 --> 41:41.820
much more

41:41.820 --> 41:42.120
likely

41:42.120 --> 41:42.680
there are

41:42.680 --> 41:42.860
some

41:42.860 --> 41:43.100
people

41:43.100 --> 41:43.700
fatigued

41:43.700 --> 41:43.920
right

41:43.920 --> 41:44.260
I mean

41:44.260 --> 41:44.820
finger

41:44.820 --> 41:45.260
fatigued

41:45.260 --> 41:45.660
you have

41:45.660 --> 41:46.060
to stare

41:46.060 --> 41:46.260
at the

41:46.260 --> 41:46.500
keyword

41:46.500 --> 41:47.600
so

41:47.600 --> 41:47.880
there's

41:47.880 --> 41:48.160
that

41:48.160 --> 41:49.480
second

41:49.480 --> 41:49.780
issue

41:49.780 --> 41:50.100
is the

41:50.100 --> 41:50.460
time

41:50.460 --> 41:51.380
it just

41:51.380 --> 41:51.580
takes

41:51.580 --> 41:51.940
longer

41:51.940 --> 41:53.400
to enter

41:53.400 --> 41:53.620
that

41:53.620 --> 41:53.940
password

41:53.940 --> 41:55.980
so

41:55.980 --> 41:57.360
while I

41:57.360 --> 41:58.100
find it

41:58.100 --> 41:58.580
commendable

41:58.580 --> 41:58.920
that you

41:58.920 --> 41:59.360
guys use

41:59.360 --> 41:59.800
this long

41:59.800 --> 42:00.220
password

42:00.220 --> 42:00.700
that's

42:00.700 --> 42:01.000
great

42:01.000 --> 42:03.480
that doesn't

42:03.480 --> 42:03.860
mean you're

42:03.860 --> 42:04.200
out of the

42:04.200 --> 42:04.440
woods

42:04.440 --> 42:05.020
with attacks

42:05.020 --> 42:05.900
you know

42:05.900 --> 42:06.600
but

42:06.600 --> 42:07.840
there is a

42:07.840 --> 42:08.220
trade-off

42:08.220 --> 42:08.700
right

42:08.700 --> 42:09.140
and most

42:09.140 --> 42:09.400
people

42:09.400 --> 42:09.800
I mean

42:09.800 --> 42:10.480
they're okay

42:10.480 --> 42:10.900
with like

42:10.900 --> 42:11.540
not super

42:11.540 --> 42:11.860
short

42:11.860 --> 42:12.220
passwords

42:12.220 --> 42:13.060
but like

42:13.060 --> 42:13.660
research

42:13.660 --> 42:14.280
show that

42:14.280 --> 42:14.660
8 is

42:14.660 --> 42:14.980
about

42:14.980 --> 42:16.160
the right

42:16.160 --> 42:16.540
mix

42:16.540 --> 42:17.680
but with

42:17.680 --> 42:17.860
8

42:17.860 --> 42:18.140
characters

42:18.160 --> 42:18.800
which is

42:18.800 --> 42:19.240
I think

42:19.240 --> 42:19.780
for most

42:19.780 --> 42:20.100
people

42:20.100 --> 42:20.880
and I

42:20.880 --> 42:21.240
suspect

42:21.240 --> 42:21.780
most people

42:21.780 --> 42:22.240
your age

42:22.240 --> 42:22.640
have picked

42:22.640 --> 42:23.220
some better

42:23.220 --> 42:23.680
passwords

42:23.680 --> 42:24.160
than let's

42:24.160 --> 42:24.500
say your

42:24.500 --> 42:24.880
uncles

42:24.880 --> 42:26.000
and grandparents

42:26.000 --> 42:27.020
and parents

42:27.020 --> 42:28.440
because you

42:28.440 --> 42:28.580
know

42:28.580 --> 42:29.320
who are less

42:29.320 --> 42:29.720
confused

42:29.720 --> 42:30.040
having

42:30.040 --> 42:30.760
you're going

42:30.760 --> 42:31.240
to wind up

42:31.240 --> 42:32.400
with roughly

42:32.400 --> 42:33.560
6 quadrillion

42:33.560 --> 42:35.680
possible passwords

42:35.680 --> 42:37.060
well to a

42:37.060 --> 42:37.520
kid this

42:37.520 --> 42:38.120
sounds really

42:38.120 --> 42:38.620
impressive

42:38.620 --> 42:38.980
right

42:38.980 --> 42:39.380
you just

42:39.380 --> 42:39.960
explain how

42:39.960 --> 42:40.420
many zeros

42:40.420 --> 42:40.720
are

42:40.720 --> 42:41.360
but we're

42:41.360 --> 42:41.880
all adults

42:41.880 --> 42:42.160
here

42:42.160 --> 42:43.100
6 quadrillion

42:43.100 --> 42:43.580
is not a

42:43.580 --> 42:44.080
large number

42:44.080 --> 42:46.100
okay

42:46.100 --> 42:47.000
not at all

42:47.000 --> 42:48.480
right

42:48.480 --> 42:49.580
and

42:49.580 --> 42:51.120
since

42:51.120 --> 42:52.240
given

42:52.240 --> 42:53.620
freedom

42:53.620 --> 42:54.140
to pick

42:54.140 --> 42:54.380
right

42:54.380 --> 42:55.000
without like

42:55.000 --> 42:55.620
actual

42:55.620 --> 42:56.160
restriction

42:56.160 --> 42:57.900
most of us

42:57.900 --> 42:58.300
will pick

42:58.300 --> 42:59.040
things like

42:59.040 --> 42:59.900
human and

42:59.900 --> 43:00.500
pet names

43:00.500 --> 43:01.040
and dictionary

43:01.040 --> 43:01.500
words

43:01.500 --> 43:02.400
we're going to

43:02.400 --> 43:02.840
wind up

43:02.840 --> 43:03.200
with

43:03.200 --> 43:05.120
20

43:05.120 --> 43:06.020
2 to the

43:06.020 --> 43:06.340
20

43:06.340 --> 43:06.860
essentially

43:06.860 --> 43:07.480
a 20-bit

43:07.480 --> 43:07.840
password

43:07.840 --> 43:09.640
which means

43:09.640 --> 43:09.940
that

43:09.940 --> 43:10.780
even if

43:10.780 --> 43:11.160
your password

43:11.160 --> 43:11.520
is 8

43:11.520 --> 43:11.980
characters

43:11.980 --> 43:13.260
the real

43:13.260 --> 43:13.740
entropy

43:13.740 --> 43:14.060
there

43:14.060 --> 43:14.180
is

43:14.180 --> 43:14.360
about

43:14.360 --> 43:14.640
20

43:14.640 --> 43:14.920
minutes

43:14.920 --> 43:19.260
meaning

43:19.260 --> 43:19.580
that

43:19.580 --> 43:20.260
human

43:20.260 --> 43:20.760
death

43:20.760 --> 43:21.200
names

43:21.200 --> 43:21.580
and all

43:21.580 --> 43:22.180
the dictionary

43:22.180 --> 43:22.600
words

43:22.600 --> 43:23.160
will roughly

43:23.160 --> 43:23.620
be about

43:23.620 --> 43:23.900
2 to the

43:23.900 --> 43:24.060
point

43:24.060 --> 43:24.520
that's

43:24.520 --> 43:24.800
assuming

43:24.800 --> 43:25.240
the language

43:25.240 --> 43:25.660
is known

43:25.660 --> 43:26.200
so you

43:26.200 --> 43:26.440
assume

43:26.440 --> 43:26.860
your password

43:26.860 --> 43:27.800
is English

43:27.800 --> 43:28.180
like

43:28.180 --> 43:29.680
if you

43:29.680 --> 43:29.980
are

43:29.980 --> 43:31.220
Swahili

43:31.220 --> 43:31.720
speaker

43:31.720 --> 43:32.720
then a whole

43:32.720 --> 43:33.000
different

43:33.000 --> 43:33.260
thing

43:33.260 --> 43:33.700
will apply

43:33.700 --> 43:34.520
it will

43:34.520 --> 43:35.000
be based

43:35.000 --> 43:35.520
on the

43:35.520 --> 43:36.280
vocabulary

43:36.280 --> 43:36.720
of that

43:36.720 --> 43:37.000
language

43:37.000 --> 43:37.840
but

43:37.840 --> 43:38.000
you

43:38.000 --> 43:38.140
have

43:38.140 --> 43:38.240
to

43:38.240 --> 43:38.520
assume

43:38.520 --> 43:38.680
that

43:38.680 --> 43:38.900
hacker

43:38.900 --> 43:39.180
knows

43:39.180 --> 43:39.380
about

43:39.380 --> 43:39.520
that

43:39.520 --> 43:42.860
yeah

43:42.860 --> 43:43.460
so

43:43.460 --> 43:44.060
and

43:44.060 --> 43:44.280
if you

43:44.280 --> 43:44.460
think

43:44.460 --> 43:44.780
pins

43:44.780 --> 43:44.920
are

43:44.920 --> 43:45.200
better

43:45.200 --> 43:45.660
they're

43:45.660 --> 43:46.000
not

43:46.000 --> 43:47.080
because

43:47.080 --> 43:48.040
you

43:48.040 --> 43:48.540
get

43:48.540 --> 43:49.080
with

43:49.080 --> 43:49.900
maximum

43:49.900 --> 43:50.460
2 to the

43:50.460 --> 43:50.980
27

43:50.980 --> 43:51.520
with

43:51.520 --> 43:51.880
8

43:51.880 --> 43:52.340
digit

43:52.340 --> 43:52.800
pins

43:52.800 --> 43:57.200
and

43:57.200 --> 43:57.520
that's

43:57.520 --> 43:57.900
something

43:57.900 --> 43:58.260
that

43:58.260 --> 43:58.920
any

43:58.920 --> 44:01.040
software

44:01.040 --> 44:01.520
on your

44:01.520 --> 44:01.760
phone

44:01.760 --> 44:02.080
you can

44:02.080 --> 44:02.740
do

44:02.740 --> 44:03.180
in

44:03.180 --> 44:03.940
seconds

44:03.940 --> 44:05.340
just

44:05.340 --> 44:05.740
iterate

44:05.740 --> 44:06.140
for all

44:06.140 --> 44:06.380
of those

44:06.380 --> 44:06.580
so

44:06.580 --> 44:06.800
that's

44:06.800 --> 44:07.060
not a

44:07.060 --> 44:07.260
scary

44:07.260 --> 44:07.600
number

44:07.600 --> 44:08.440
on

44:08.440 --> 44:08.580
the

44:08.580 --> 44:09.080
websites

44:09.080 --> 44:09.940
they often

44:09.940 --> 44:10.780
restrict

44:10.780 --> 44:11.360
length

44:11.360 --> 44:11.640
for

44:11.640 --> 44:12.960
I get

44:12.960 --> 44:13.460
they have

44:13.460 --> 44:13.780
to store

44:13.780 --> 44:14.080
in a

44:14.080 --> 44:14.500
database

44:14.500 --> 44:14.860
somehow

44:14.860 --> 44:15.800
but why

44:15.800 --> 44:17.600
in the

44:17.600 --> 44:17.940
world

44:17.940 --> 44:18.300
would they

44:18.300 --> 44:18.580
ever

44:18.580 --> 44:18.780
that

44:18.780 --> 44:19.000
takes

44:19.000 --> 44:19.480
no sense

44:19.480 --> 44:19.800
to me

44:19.800 --> 44:20.000
either

44:20.000 --> 44:20.360
symbols

44:20.360 --> 44:21.200
they

44:21.200 --> 44:22.280
so

44:22.280 --> 44:22.860
I think

44:22.860 --> 44:23.380
the reason

44:23.380 --> 44:23.800
okay

44:23.800 --> 44:24.740
you're asking

44:24.740 --> 44:25.300
two questions

44:25.300 --> 44:26.140
why do they

44:26.140 --> 44:26.460
restrict

44:26.460 --> 44:26.800
the length

44:26.800 --> 44:27.540
and why

44:27.540 --> 44:27.920
they don't

44:27.920 --> 44:28.120
allow

44:28.120 --> 44:28.480
symbols

44:28.480 --> 44:29.920
none of

44:29.920 --> 44:30.320
those two

44:30.320 --> 44:30.680
none of

44:30.680 --> 44:31.000
those two

44:31.000 --> 44:31.480
make sense

44:31.480 --> 44:31.920
to me

44:31.920 --> 44:32.540
but I have

44:32.540 --> 44:33.320
a potential

44:33.320 --> 44:33.980
explanation

44:33.980 --> 44:35.040
for why

44:35.040 --> 44:35.220
they don't

44:35.220 --> 44:35.780
allow certain

44:35.780 --> 44:36.220
symbols

44:36.220 --> 44:36.720
is because

44:36.720 --> 44:37.320
they think

44:37.320 --> 44:38.040
these are

44:38.040 --> 44:38.600
executable

44:38.600 --> 44:39.020
some kind

44:39.020 --> 44:39.320
of like

44:39.320 --> 44:39.520
they're

44:39.520 --> 44:40.320
trigger symbols

44:40.320 --> 44:41.920
that somehow

44:41.920 --> 44:43.400
some of

44:43.400 --> 44:44.020
these things

44:44.020 --> 44:44.440
like

44:44.440 --> 44:47.480
slash slash

44:47.480 --> 44:48.200
or back

44:48.200 --> 44:48.700
slash back

44:48.700 --> 44:49.840
dollar sign

44:49.840 --> 44:50.560
can be used

44:50.560 --> 44:52.480
if you somehow

44:52.480 --> 44:53.380
cause a buffer

44:53.380 --> 44:53.960
overflow

44:53.960 --> 44:55.460
they can

44:55.460 --> 44:56.420
so there's

44:56.420 --> 44:56.820
some like

44:56.820 --> 44:57.560
suspicion

44:57.560 --> 44:58.920
of these symbols

44:58.920 --> 45:00.220
dating back years

45:00.220 --> 45:00.860
nobody really

45:00.860 --> 45:01.520
knows why

45:01.520 --> 45:02.520
but that's

45:02.520 --> 45:03.120
my suspicion

45:03.120 --> 45:03.900
why

45:03.900 --> 45:04.360
do they

45:04.360 --> 45:05.240
truncate

45:05.240 --> 45:07.080
and allow

45:07.080 --> 45:07.600
only

45:07.600 --> 45:08.680
fixed

45:08.680 --> 45:09.700
up to a certain

45:09.700 --> 45:10.020
number of

45:10.020 --> 45:10.220
characters

45:10.220 --> 45:10.860
I don't know

45:10.860 --> 45:11.140
that

45:11.140 --> 45:12.540
that may be

45:12.540 --> 45:14.280
it makes no

45:14.280 --> 45:15.060
sense because

45:15.060 --> 45:16.780
it's hashed

45:16.780 --> 45:18.820
and it may be

45:18.820 --> 45:19.460
again that

45:19.460 --> 45:20.440
whoever programmed

45:20.440 --> 45:21.280
the front end

45:21.280 --> 45:24.120
no

45:24.120 --> 45:25.860
they're also

45:25.860 --> 45:26.540
afraid of

45:26.540 --> 45:27.040
these kind

45:27.040 --> 45:27.440
of buffer

45:27.440 --> 45:28.100
overflows

45:28.100 --> 45:28.640
and so on

45:28.640 --> 45:29.120
and memory

45:29.120 --> 45:29.820
bugs

45:29.820 --> 45:30.920
because

45:30.920 --> 45:31.300
you allow

45:31.300 --> 45:32.120
unlimited number

45:32.120 --> 45:32.740
of characters

45:32.740 --> 45:33.300
they're thinking

45:33.300 --> 45:33.720
you're going to

45:33.720 --> 45:34.520
enter 2,000

45:34.520 --> 45:35.040
characters

45:35.040 --> 45:35.980
something is going

45:35.980 --> 45:36.340
to break

45:36.340 --> 45:36.800
in the code

45:36.800 --> 45:38.300
I know

45:38.300 --> 45:38.860
I know

45:38.860 --> 45:39.920
I'm with you

45:39.920 --> 45:40.240
on that

45:40.240 --> 45:40.960
I think that's

45:40.960 --> 45:41.240
silly

45:41.240 --> 45:42.460
right because

45:42.460 --> 45:43.240
there's no

45:43.240 --> 45:43.800
justification

45:43.800 --> 45:44.760
it's only the

45:44.760 --> 45:45.260
front end

45:45.260 --> 45:46.860
because of the

45:46.860 --> 45:47.380
back end

45:47.380 --> 45:48.400
they're hashed

45:48.400 --> 45:48.740
and they're all

45:48.740 --> 45:49.340
the same way

45:49.340 --> 45:58.280
it's a heat

45:58.280 --> 45:58.480
map

45:58.480 --> 45:59.400
some of the

45:59.400 --> 45:59.980
stuff I'll show

45:59.980 --> 46:00.480
you is really

46:00.480 --> 46:00.880
dated

46:00.880 --> 46:02.300
dated as in

46:02.300 --> 46:02.940
like 10 years

46:02.940 --> 46:03.200
old

46:03.200 --> 46:03.820
more than 10

46:03.820 --> 46:04.060
years old

46:04.060 --> 46:04.660
none of it

46:04.660 --> 46:05.380
changed since

46:05.380 --> 46:07.120
people still

46:07.120 --> 46:07.500
think

46:07.500 --> 46:09.260
similar

46:09.260 --> 46:09.540
faster

46:09.540 --> 46:10.040
because the

46:10.040 --> 46:10.440
fundamental

46:10.440 --> 46:10.900
human

46:10.900 --> 46:12.040
mentality

46:12.040 --> 46:12.360
hasn't

46:12.360 --> 46:12.680
changed

46:12.680 --> 46:14.380
what is

46:14.380 --> 46:14.720
a heat

46:14.720 --> 46:14.900
map

46:14.900 --> 46:15.120
what does

46:15.120 --> 46:15.440
it mean

46:15.440 --> 46:15.920
is that

46:15.920 --> 46:16.500
you see

46:16.500 --> 46:16.840
where

46:16.840 --> 46:18.120
things are

46:18.120 --> 46:18.480
really

46:18.480 --> 46:19.480
hot

46:19.480 --> 46:19.700
there

46:19.700 --> 46:20.020
yellow

46:20.020 --> 46:20.500
right

46:20.500 --> 46:23.760
and so

46:23.760 --> 46:24.600
over here

46:24.600 --> 46:25.380
it's a heat

46:25.380 --> 46:26.020
map generated

46:26.020 --> 46:26.820
from a

46:26.820 --> 46:27.080
leaked

46:27.080 --> 46:27.560
password

46:27.560 --> 46:28.140
database

46:28.140 --> 46:29.460
a giant

46:29.460 --> 46:29.800
leaked

46:29.800 --> 46:30.200
password

46:30.200 --> 46:30.540
database

46:30.540 --> 46:31.520
okay

46:31.520 --> 46:33.240
so

46:33.240 --> 46:35.060
this is

46:35.060 --> 46:37.060
a pin

46:37.060 --> 46:37.400
sorry

46:37.400 --> 46:37.860
this is not

46:37.860 --> 46:38.520
a pin

46:38.520 --> 46:39.020
heat map

46:39.020 --> 46:39.860
and so

46:39.860 --> 46:40.260
over here

46:40.260 --> 46:40.620
where it's

46:40.620 --> 46:41.260
really hot

46:41.260 --> 46:43.440
dates

46:43.440 --> 46:45.640
dates are

46:45.640 --> 46:45.980
different

46:45.980 --> 46:46.580
from other

46:46.580 --> 46:46.900
pins

46:46.900 --> 46:47.700
this is

46:47.700 --> 46:49.280
you know

46:49.280 --> 46:49.820
day

46:49.820 --> 46:50.080
day

46:50.080 --> 46:50.340
month

46:50.340 --> 46:50.640
month

46:50.640 --> 46:50.920
type

46:50.920 --> 46:51.240
dates

46:51.240 --> 46:51.560
right

46:51.560 --> 46:52.600
and then

46:52.600 --> 46:53.880
related couplets

46:53.880 --> 46:54.560
meaning repeated

46:54.560 --> 46:55.420
things like

46:55.420 --> 46:56.060
0101

46:56.060 --> 46:57.620
0505

46:57.620 --> 46:59.100
667

46:59.100 --> 47:00.680
they're all

47:00.680 --> 47:01.260
along this

47:01.260 --> 47:02.700
diagonal thing

47:02.700 --> 47:04.280
okay

47:04.280 --> 47:06.220
and these are

47:06.220 --> 47:06.980
years of

47:06.980 --> 47:07.740
specific years

47:07.740 --> 47:08.760
of 19 something

47:08.760 --> 47:12.320
because probably

47:12.320 --> 47:13.000
birth years

47:13.000 --> 47:13.600
people

47:13.600 --> 47:13.620
for people

47:13.620 --> 47:15.080
to take

47:15.080 --> 47:15.460
passwords

47:15.460 --> 47:15.720
back

47:15.720 --> 47:19.220
so

47:19.220 --> 47:20.260
as I said

47:20.260 --> 47:20.700
before

47:20.700 --> 47:21.460
the

47:21.460 --> 47:23.160
Unix

47:23.160 --> 47:23.800
and all

47:23.800 --> 47:24.140
the other

47:24.140 --> 47:24.500
Unix

47:24.500 --> 47:25.980
like systems

47:25.980 --> 47:26.760
have this

47:26.760 --> 47:27.600
etsy

47:27.600 --> 47:28.540
password file

47:28.540 --> 47:28.900
and it's

47:28.900 --> 47:29.480
world readable

47:29.480 --> 47:30.320
for reasons

47:30.320 --> 47:30.620
I already

47:30.620 --> 47:31.060
explained

47:31.060 --> 47:32.560
so

47:32.560 --> 47:35.460
if you don't

47:35.460 --> 47:35.960
do anything

47:35.960 --> 47:36.300
and just

47:36.300 --> 47:36.960
store the

47:36.960 --> 47:38.620
hashed

47:38.620 --> 47:39.080
passwords

47:39.080 --> 47:39.520
in that

47:39.520 --> 47:39.920
file

47:39.920 --> 47:41.120
the attacker

47:41.120 --> 47:41.560
will

47:41.560 --> 47:43.340
easily

47:43.340 --> 47:44.000
before

47:44.000 --> 47:45.560
even knowing

47:45.560 --> 47:45.960
what that

47:45.960 --> 47:46.480
file is

47:46.480 --> 47:47.120
before breaking

47:47.120 --> 47:47.800
in or getting

47:47.800 --> 47:48.220
an accident

47:48.220 --> 47:48.960
the attacker

47:48.960 --> 47:49.800
can precompute

47:49.800 --> 47:51.160
a large table

47:51.160 --> 47:51.800
of all the

47:51.800 --> 47:52.060
hashed

47:52.060 --> 47:52.400
passwords

47:52.400 --> 47:54.800
yeah

47:54.800 --> 47:56.900
I mean

47:56.900 --> 47:57.620
passwords are

47:57.620 --> 47:58.220
passwords right

47:58.220 --> 47:58.700
you can just

47:58.700 --> 47:59.200
pick all the

47:59.200 --> 48:00.180
dictionary words

48:00.180 --> 48:01.060
all the dictionary

48:01.060 --> 48:01.440
words are

48:01.440 --> 48:01.800
reversed

48:01.800 --> 48:02.500
all the

48:02.500 --> 48:02.920
two word

48:02.920 --> 48:03.500
combination

48:03.500 --> 48:05.200
let's restrict

48:05.200 --> 48:05.840
our discussion

48:05.840 --> 48:06.340
to English

48:06.340 --> 48:06.780
for now

48:06.780 --> 48:07.160
okay

48:07.160 --> 48:07.800
because

48:07.800 --> 48:08.720
similar things

48:08.720 --> 48:09.200
apply to

48:09.200 --> 48:10.620
other languages

48:10.620 --> 48:11.280
but let's say

48:11.280 --> 48:11.760
yeah

48:11.760 --> 48:12.760
all the date

48:12.760 --> 48:14.700
in a standard

48:14.700 --> 48:15.680
US format

48:15.680 --> 48:16.620
all the

48:16.620 --> 48:17.540
even times

48:17.540 --> 48:18.060
of day

48:18.060 --> 48:18.760
using

48:18.760 --> 48:19.460
you know

48:19.460 --> 48:20.040
after a second

48:20.040 --> 48:20.440
let's say

48:20.440 --> 48:21.040
granularity

48:21.040 --> 48:21.740
you can precompute

48:21.740 --> 48:22.480
hashes of all

48:22.480 --> 48:23.120
these values

48:23.120 --> 48:24.000
combinations

48:24.000 --> 48:24.620
of all these

48:24.620 --> 48:25.060
values

48:25.060 --> 48:26.160
pet names

48:26.160 --> 48:27.700
city names

48:27.700 --> 48:29.520
state names

48:29.520 --> 48:31.120
university

48:31.120 --> 48:32.400
mascot names

48:32.400 --> 48:33.560
right

48:33.560 --> 48:34.920
all of these

48:34.920 --> 48:35.820
can be precomputed

48:35.820 --> 48:36.260
in a large

48:36.260 --> 48:36.500
database

48:36.500 --> 48:37.300
stored in a large

48:37.300 --> 48:37.560
database

48:37.560 --> 48:38.720
that is something

48:38.720 --> 48:39.420
a task that

48:39.420 --> 48:39.880
an adversary

48:39.880 --> 48:40.520
could do

48:40.520 --> 48:41.480
and would take

48:41.480 --> 48:42.240
maybe a day

48:42.240 --> 48:42.580
or two

48:42.580 --> 48:43.360
maybe less

48:43.360 --> 48:44.500
this can be

48:44.500 --> 48:44.880
stored

48:44.880 --> 48:45.420
and it can be

48:45.420 --> 48:45.920
done at your

48:45.920 --> 48:46.360
own leisure

48:46.360 --> 48:47.320
now

48:47.320 --> 48:48.000
at the time

48:48.000 --> 48:48.640
of intrusion

48:48.640 --> 48:49.220
when the

48:49.220 --> 48:50.020
adversary gains

48:50.020 --> 48:50.620
access to

48:50.620 --> 48:51.760
the password

48:51.760 --> 48:52.220
file

48:52.220 --> 48:52.720
all the

48:52.720 --> 48:53.080
adversary

48:53.080 --> 48:53.600
needs to

48:53.600 --> 48:53.860
do

48:53.860 --> 48:55.020
is extract

48:55.020 --> 48:55.460
the hashed

48:55.460 --> 48:55.900
passports

48:55.900 --> 48:56.360
and do it

48:56.360 --> 48:56.640
database

48:56.640 --> 48:57.040
basically

48:57.040 --> 48:59.660
am I with you

48:59.660 --> 49:01.040
very simple

49:01.040 --> 49:02.740
so a little bit

49:02.740 --> 49:03.300
of work ahead

49:03.300 --> 49:03.640
of it

49:03.640 --> 49:05.260
and then

49:05.260 --> 49:05.900
no work

49:05.900 --> 49:06.400
essentially

49:06.400 --> 49:07.320
once the

49:07.320 --> 49:08.460
password file

49:08.460 --> 49:09.160
becomes available

49:09.160 --> 49:10.620
not only that

49:10.620 --> 49:10.900
but the

49:10.900 --> 49:11.380
adversary can

49:11.380 --> 49:11.780
break into

49:11.780 --> 49:12.740
multiple systems

49:12.740 --> 49:14.120
and reuse

49:14.120 --> 49:14.700
that same

49:14.700 --> 49:15.520
work that

49:15.520 --> 49:16.180
we did

49:16.180 --> 49:16.700
earlier

49:16.700 --> 49:17.640
right

49:17.640 --> 49:18.120
it's not like

49:18.120 --> 49:18.520
he has to

49:18.520 --> 49:19.280
brute force

49:19.280 --> 49:19.980
anything again

49:19.980 --> 49:21.180
just a bunch

49:21.180 --> 49:21.680
of database

49:21.680 --> 49:22.120
who comes

49:22.120 --> 49:24.460
so that's

49:24.460 --> 49:24.980
nice

49:24.980 --> 49:25.500
for the

49:25.500 --> 49:25.880
adversary

49:25.880 --> 49:26.600
bad for

49:26.600 --> 49:26.900
us

49:26.900 --> 49:29.020
right

49:29.020 --> 49:30.800
this is

49:30.800 --> 49:31.200
called an

49:31.200 --> 49:31.680
offline

49:31.680 --> 49:32.120
attack

49:32.120 --> 49:33.740
because the

49:33.740 --> 49:34.380
adversary has

49:34.380 --> 49:34.800
done the

49:34.800 --> 49:35.180
bulk of

49:35.180 --> 49:35.580
the work

49:35.580 --> 49:36.240
offline

49:36.240 --> 49:37.800
and online

49:37.800 --> 49:38.260
just does

49:38.260 --> 49:38.740
lookouts

49:38.740 --> 49:43.340
so that's

49:43.340 --> 49:43.880
why salt

49:43.880 --> 49:45.200
unlike what

49:45.200 --> 49:45.620
the doctors

49:45.620 --> 49:46.260
say is good

49:46.260 --> 49:46.620
for you

49:46.620 --> 49:50.040
we don't

49:50.040 --> 49:50.800
store hash

49:50.800 --> 49:51.460
passwords in

49:51.460 --> 49:51.660
new

49:51.660 --> 49:52.860
password file

49:52.860 --> 49:53.720
we store

49:53.720 --> 49:54.180
salted

49:54.180 --> 49:54.640
passwords

49:54.640 --> 49:56.160
salted

49:56.160 --> 49:56.580
means

49:56.580 --> 49:57.940
at the

49:57.940 --> 49:58.400
time of

49:58.400 --> 49:59.020
the initial

49:59.020 --> 50:00.120
creation of

50:00.120 --> 50:00.460
a user

50:00.460 --> 50:00.920
account

50:00.920 --> 50:02.760
the system

50:02.760 --> 50:03.100
or the

50:03.100 --> 50:03.780
administrator

50:03.780 --> 50:04.900
will pick

50:04.900 --> 50:05.360
a random

50:05.360 --> 50:05.800
number

50:05.800 --> 50:07.140
called a

50:07.140 --> 50:07.380
salt

50:07.380 --> 50:09.240
that random

50:09.240 --> 50:09.760
number is

50:09.760 --> 50:10.220
only used

50:10.220 --> 50:10.880
there in

50:10.880 --> 50:11.240
the password

50:11.240 --> 50:11.680
file

50:11.680 --> 50:13.380
it isn't

50:13.380 --> 50:13.880
stored in

50:13.880 --> 50:14.180
the plain

50:14.180 --> 50:14.480
text

50:14.480 --> 50:16.700
but it's

50:16.700 --> 50:17.960
not reused

50:17.960 --> 50:19.100
so different

50:19.100 --> 50:19.840
systems will

50:19.840 --> 50:20.280
have different

50:20.280 --> 50:20.900
salts for the

50:20.900 --> 50:21.480
same user

50:21.480 --> 50:24.980
so you

50:24.980 --> 50:25.540
have a record

50:25.540 --> 50:26.100
something that

50:26.100 --> 50:26.620
looks something

50:26.620 --> 50:27.180
like this

50:27.180 --> 50:28.760
this is maybe

50:28.760 --> 50:29.620
a little outdated

50:29.620 --> 50:30.840
that green box

50:30.840 --> 50:31.200
you see

50:31.200 --> 50:32.560
gts would be my

50:32.560 --> 50:33.280
account name

50:33.280 --> 50:35.560
the salt will be

50:35.560 --> 50:36.280
that number

50:36.280 --> 50:37.220
right

50:37.220 --> 50:38.560
the first blue

50:38.560 --> 50:38.920
number

50:38.920 --> 50:40.400
the second is

50:40.400 --> 50:41.020
the hash

50:41.020 --> 50:42.320
then you have

50:42.320 --> 50:42.980
like user

50:42.980 --> 50:43.540
identity

50:43.540 --> 50:44.080
uid

50:44.080 --> 50:44.880
i think that

50:44.880 --> 50:46.020
the 14510 is

50:46.020 --> 50:46.460
uid

50:46.460 --> 50:47.500
30 i don't

50:47.500 --> 50:47.640
remember

50:47.640 --> 50:48.620
group id or

50:48.620 --> 50:48.940
something

50:48.940 --> 50:49.940
then the full

50:49.940 --> 50:50.440
name

50:50.440 --> 50:51.840
like what my

50:51.840 --> 50:52.540
actual name is

50:52.540 --> 50:53.180
and then the

50:53.180 --> 50:53.860
login shell

50:53.860 --> 50:54.620
right

50:54.620 --> 50:55.800
and today is

50:55.800 --> 50:56.320
probably like a

50:56.320 --> 50:56.720
lot more

50:56.720 --> 50:58.460
at least that

50:58.460 --> 50:59.960
but we're not

50:59.960 --> 51:00.520
interested in

51:00.520 --> 51:01.380
the rest of the

51:01.380 --> 51:01.680
stuff

51:01.680 --> 51:02.300
the important

51:02.300 --> 51:02.840
thing is

51:02.840 --> 51:03.600
the salt

51:03.600 --> 51:03.920
and the

51:03.920 --> 51:04.340
password

51:04.340 --> 51:04.840
that has

51:04.840 --> 51:05.300
together

51:05.300 --> 51:07.600
okay

51:07.600 --> 51:08.180
so what

51:08.180 --> 51:08.520
happens

51:08.520 --> 51:09.400
very simple

51:09.400 --> 51:10.880
little mandate

51:10.880 --> 51:11.240
right

51:11.240 --> 51:11.860
but makes a

51:11.860 --> 51:12.420
big difference

51:12.420 --> 51:15.440
that offline

51:15.440 --> 51:16.560
attack

51:16.560 --> 51:17.300
is no longer

51:17.300 --> 51:17.800
possible

51:17.800 --> 51:22.060
why not

51:22.060 --> 51:26.460
well let me

51:26.460 --> 51:26.820
give you an

51:26.820 --> 51:27.080
example

51:27.080 --> 51:27.680
suppose the

51:27.680 --> 51:28.140
salt was

51:28.140 --> 51:29.440
one decimal

51:29.440 --> 51:29.800
digit

51:29.800 --> 51:33.560
would the

51:33.560 --> 51:33.900
offline

51:33.900 --> 51:34.240
attack

51:34.240 --> 51:34.400
be

51:34.400 --> 51:34.760
possible

51:34.760 --> 51:39.560
one

51:39.560 --> 51:39.900
just one

51:39.900 --> 51:40.200
decimal

51:40.200 --> 51:40.440
digit

51:40.440 --> 51:40.700
meaning

51:40.700 --> 51:41.100
it's a

51:41.100 --> 51:41.320
number

51:41.320 --> 51:41.820
from zero

51:41.820 --> 51:42.400
to ten

51:42.400 --> 51:44.540
would it

51:44.540 --> 51:44.880
be possible

51:44.880 --> 51:45.300
to mount

51:45.300 --> 51:46.140
this offline

51:46.140 --> 51:46.500
attack

51:46.500 --> 51:48.960
of course

51:48.960 --> 51:49.520
it's possible

51:49.520 --> 51:50.360
why not

51:50.360 --> 51:50.700
right

51:50.700 --> 51:51.880
just the work

51:51.880 --> 51:53.000
increases tenfold

51:53.000 --> 51:55.900
right

51:55.900 --> 51:56.500
but okay

51:56.500 --> 51:57.060
now it depends

51:57.060 --> 51:57.640
on how long

51:57.640 --> 51:58.440
exactly you make

51:58.440 --> 51:58.560
it

51:58.560 --> 51:59.060
but suppose

51:59.060 --> 51:59.660
you make it

51:59.660 --> 52:01.700
128 bits

52:01.700 --> 52:03.700
oh

52:03.700 --> 52:04.600
now

52:04.600 --> 52:05.800
one digit

52:05.800 --> 52:06.900
128 bits

52:06.900 --> 52:07.620
instead of

52:07.620 --> 52:07.980
like what

52:07.980 --> 52:08.760
one digit

52:08.760 --> 52:09.180
is like

52:09.180 --> 52:09.720
three digits

52:09.720 --> 52:10.660
right

52:10.660 --> 52:12.040
so from three

52:12.040 --> 52:12.820
bits to 128

52:12.820 --> 52:13.120
bits

52:13.120 --> 52:13.540
now the

52:13.540 --> 52:13.840
adversary

52:13.840 --> 52:14.600
cannot do

52:14.600 --> 52:15.840
cannot do

52:15.840 --> 52:17.100
an offline

52:17.100 --> 52:17.500
attack

52:17.500 --> 52:18.940
because remember

52:18.940 --> 52:19.720
for every

52:19.720 --> 52:20.300
guess of the

52:20.300 --> 52:20.700
password

52:20.700 --> 52:22.220
that the

52:22.220 --> 52:22.580
adversary

52:22.580 --> 52:22.980
makes

52:22.980 --> 52:25.260
he has to

52:25.260 --> 52:25.920
multiply

52:25.920 --> 52:26.660
do it

52:26.660 --> 52:27.600
two to the

52:27.600 --> 52:28.560
128 times

52:28.560 --> 52:32.400
per password

52:32.400 --> 52:34.400
so it

52:34.400 --> 52:34.760
will be

52:34.760 --> 52:35.300
two to the

52:35.300 --> 52:36.300
128 times

52:36.300 --> 52:36.580
whatever

52:36.580 --> 52:37.260
even two to

52:37.260 --> 52:37.760
the 20

52:37.760 --> 52:38.100
right

52:38.100 --> 52:38.840
is

52:38.840 --> 52:40.900
beyond reach

52:40.900 --> 52:41.180
of the

52:41.180 --> 52:41.540
adversary

52:41.540 --> 52:42.160
today and

52:42.160 --> 52:42.400
for

52:42.400 --> 52:42.960
what it

52:42.960 --> 52:43.380
would be

52:43.380 --> 52:46.100
so originally

52:46.100 --> 52:46.740
they made the

52:46.740 --> 52:46.980
salt

52:46.980 --> 52:47.640
32 bits

52:47.640 --> 52:48.160
I'm not sure

52:48.160 --> 52:48.720
exactly what

52:48.720 --> 52:48.980
it is

52:48.980 --> 52:49.340
because it

52:49.340 --> 52:49.580
varies

52:49.580 --> 52:50.040
I think the

52:50.040 --> 52:50.440
length of the

52:50.440 --> 52:50.940
salt varies

52:50.940 --> 52:51.480
from unique

52:51.480 --> 52:52.060
flavor

52:52.060 --> 52:52.480
to unique

52:52.480 --> 52:52.820
flavor

52:52.820 --> 52:54.140
but if I

52:54.140 --> 52:54.520
were using

52:54.520 --> 52:54.880
it today

52:54.880 --> 52:55.180
I would

52:55.180 --> 52:55.500
want the

52:55.500 --> 52:55.820
salt to

52:55.820 --> 52:56.100
be at

52:56.100 --> 52:56.360
least

52:56.360 --> 52:58.420
80 but

52:58.420 --> 52:59.180
probably

52:59.180 --> 52:59.800
more like

52:59.800 --> 53:00.260
128

53:00.260 --> 53:00.840
than salt

53:00.840 --> 53:01.100
is

53:01.100 --> 53:02.660
healthier

53:02.660 --> 53:05.100
okay

53:05.100 --> 53:05.800
but salt

53:05.800 --> 53:06.420
makes a big

53:06.420 --> 53:06.800
difference

53:06.800 --> 53:07.840
now once the

53:07.840 --> 53:08.660
attacker breaks

53:08.660 --> 53:09.020
in

53:09.020 --> 53:11.200
okay

53:11.200 --> 53:12.360
now there's a

53:12.360 --> 53:12.980
crucial difference

53:12.980 --> 53:13.660
between offline

53:13.660 --> 53:14.240
and online

53:14.240 --> 53:14.560
attack

53:14.560 --> 53:16.320
once the

53:16.320 --> 53:16.640
attacker

53:16.640 --> 53:17.140
breaks in

53:17.140 --> 53:18.400
and reads

53:18.400 --> 53:18.640
the

53:18.640 --> 53:19.360
lc password

53:19.360 --> 53:19.740
file

53:19.740 --> 53:20.120
okay

53:20.120 --> 53:21.660
the attacker

53:21.660 --> 53:22.120
sees the

53:22.120 --> 53:22.320
salt

53:22.320 --> 53:24.360
so then the

53:24.360 --> 53:24.940
attack becomes

53:24.940 --> 53:25.480
much cheaper

53:25.480 --> 53:27.060
but it can

53:27.060 --> 53:27.440
only be

53:27.440 --> 53:27.820
mounted

53:27.820 --> 53:29.200
once he

53:29.200 --> 53:30.160
breaks in

53:30.160 --> 53:32.200
not ahead

53:32.200 --> 53:35.660
because

53:35.660 --> 53:36.580
by knowing

53:36.580 --> 53:37.100
the salt

53:37.100 --> 53:38.180
you shave

53:38.180 --> 53:38.600
off the

53:38.600 --> 53:38.940
2 to the

53:38.940 --> 53:39.280
128

53:39.280 --> 53:41.400
okay

53:41.400 --> 53:45.840
and that

53:45.840 --> 53:46.280
basically

53:46.280 --> 53:47.880
the explanation

53:47.880 --> 53:48.280
is the same

53:48.280 --> 53:48.480
thing

53:48.480 --> 53:51.860
just take a

53:51.860 --> 53:52.060
second

53:52.060 --> 53:52.580
to read it

53:52.580 --> 53:55.940
well you shave

53:55.940 --> 53:56.260
off the

53:56.260 --> 53:56.580
2 to the

53:56.580 --> 53:57.140
number 28

53:57.140 --> 53:57.660
but it's

53:57.660 --> 53:58.260
no longer

53:58.260 --> 53:59.400
only off

53:59.400 --> 53:59.920
line

53:59.920 --> 54:00.740
fully attack

54:00.740 --> 54:01.820
no no

54:01.820 --> 54:02.400
it's online

54:02.400 --> 54:03.100
it's online

54:03.100 --> 54:03.720
it's not

54:03.720 --> 54:04.960
offline

54:04.960 --> 54:05.360
at all

54:05.360 --> 54:06.460
the attacker

54:06.460 --> 54:07.080
breaks in

54:07.080 --> 54:07.760
learns the

54:07.760 --> 54:07.940
salt

54:07.940 --> 54:08.300
and now

54:08.300 --> 54:08.880
has to do

54:08.880 --> 54:09.440
with that

54:09.440 --> 54:09.780
salt

54:09.780 --> 54:11.120
whatever

54:11.120 --> 54:11.640
2 to the

54:11.640 --> 54:11.980
20

54:11.980 --> 54:12.500
2 to the

54:12.500 --> 54:12.820
40

54:12.820 --> 54:13.680
however many

54:13.680 --> 54:14.080
password

54:14.080 --> 54:14.420
guesses

54:14.420 --> 54:15.400
there are

54:15.400 --> 54:16.560
per user

54:16.560 --> 54:16.920
yeah

54:16.920 --> 54:18.860
so there's

54:18.860 --> 54:19.240
still a bit

54:19.240 --> 54:19.580
of work

54:19.580 --> 54:19.900
but it's

54:19.900 --> 54:20.320
not a scary

54:20.320 --> 54:20.880
amount of work

54:20.880 --> 54:26.080
I'm sorry

54:26.080 --> 54:27.020
I mean

54:27.020 --> 54:27.460
we can

54:27.460 --> 54:28.100
let the salt

54:28.100 --> 54:28.960
expire

54:28.960 --> 54:30.340
well

54:30.340 --> 54:30.820
you can

54:30.820 --> 54:31.560
let the salt

54:31.560 --> 54:32.380
expire

54:32.380 --> 54:33.060
but you

54:33.060 --> 54:33.420
have to

54:33.420 --> 54:34.080
replace it

54:34.080 --> 54:34.420
in the

54:34.420 --> 54:34.840
password

54:34.840 --> 54:35.260
file

54:35.260 --> 54:35.940
so

54:35.940 --> 54:36.900
what you're

54:36.900 --> 54:37.200
saying

54:37.200 --> 54:37.600
is that

54:37.600 --> 54:37.960
you know

54:37.960 --> 54:38.220
if you

54:38.220 --> 54:38.520
know

54:38.520 --> 54:38.740
that

54:38.740 --> 54:38.900
they

54:38.900 --> 54:39.140
have

54:39.140 --> 54:39.280
the

54:39.280 --> 54:39.360
so

54:39.360 --> 54:39.460
it

54:39.460 --> 54:39.740
takes

54:39.740 --> 54:40.100
at least

54:40.100 --> 54:40.540
24

54:40.540 --> 54:41.000
hours

54:41.000 --> 54:42.840
to

54:42.840 --> 54:43.320
mount

54:43.320 --> 54:43.520
an

54:43.520 --> 54:44.120
online

54:44.120 --> 54:44.520
attack

54:44.520 --> 54:44.860
once

54:44.860 --> 54:45.020
he

54:45.020 --> 54:45.240
learns

54:45.240 --> 54:45.480
the

54:45.480 --> 54:45.740
salt

54:45.740 --> 54:47.080
then

54:47.080 --> 54:47.200
you

54:47.200 --> 54:47.320
could

54:47.320 --> 54:47.580
change

54:47.580 --> 54:47.760
the

54:47.760 --> 54:47.980
salt

54:47.980 --> 54:48.240
every

54:48.240 --> 54:48.660
24

54:48.660 --> 54:48.900
hour

54:48.900 --> 54:50.560
you could

54:50.560 --> 54:51.760
but the

54:51.760 --> 54:52.440
problem is

54:52.440 --> 54:54.940
okay

54:54.940 --> 54:56.380
so this is a good question

54:56.380 --> 54:58.480
let's think about this

54:58.480 --> 55:02.640
that what you say

55:02.640 --> 55:03.980
would be useful

55:03.980 --> 55:04.640
or would be

55:04.640 --> 55:05.340
possible

55:05.340 --> 55:06.140
if

55:06.140 --> 55:07.560
just

55:07.560 --> 55:08.760
a password

55:08.760 --> 55:09.180
attack

55:09.180 --> 55:09.780
a brute force

55:09.780 --> 55:10.160
password

55:10.160 --> 55:10.580
attack

55:10.580 --> 55:11.040
would take

55:11.040 --> 55:11.420
24

55:11.420 --> 55:11.760
hours

55:11.760 --> 55:13.420
but remember

55:13.420 --> 55:14.240
once the adversary

55:14.240 --> 55:14.840
breaks in

55:14.840 --> 55:15.360
and learns

55:15.360 --> 55:15.900
the salt

55:15.900 --> 55:18.160
he then

55:18.160 --> 55:19.960
also knows

55:19.960 --> 55:21.060
the hash of the salt

55:21.060 --> 55:21.660
and the password

55:21.660 --> 55:22.020
right

55:22.020 --> 55:22.780
so the adversary

55:22.780 --> 55:23.580
knows this

55:23.580 --> 55:23.840
right

55:23.840 --> 55:24.100
that

55:24.100 --> 55:25.020
the

55:25.020 --> 55:27.260
well

55:27.260 --> 55:27.680
that

55:27.680 --> 55:34.000
the adversary

55:34.000 --> 55:34.860
knows this

55:34.860 --> 55:35.860
right

55:35.860 --> 55:37.400
once he breaks in

55:37.400 --> 55:38.000
he knows this

55:38.000 --> 55:39.360
and he also knows

55:39.360 --> 55:39.820
the salt

55:39.820 --> 55:43.080
so you can change

55:43.080 --> 55:43.620
the salt

55:43.620 --> 55:46.060
but he learned

55:46.060 --> 55:47.180
the previous salt

55:47.180 --> 55:47.820
and the hash

55:47.820 --> 55:48.740
of the previous salt

55:48.740 --> 55:49.400
plus password

55:49.400 --> 55:51.420
he's gonna break

55:51.420 --> 55:51.920
the password

55:51.920 --> 55:53.760
see

55:53.760 --> 55:55.580
he's gonna break

55:55.580 --> 55:55.940
the password

55:55.940 --> 55:57.720
so changing the salt

55:57.720 --> 55:58.380
at that point

55:58.380 --> 55:59.720
not effective

55:59.720 --> 56:01.480
not effective

56:01.480 --> 56:02.880
because

56:02.880 --> 56:04.100
if he's breaking

56:04.100 --> 56:04.660
it locally

56:04.660 --> 56:05.020
maybe

56:05.020 --> 56:05.320
but

56:05.320 --> 56:05.780
you know

56:05.780 --> 56:06.100
others

56:06.100 --> 56:06.440
he's gonna

56:06.440 --> 56:07.020
exfiltrate

56:07.020 --> 56:07.520
and break

56:07.520 --> 56:08.020
it on his own

56:08.020 --> 56:08.340
path

56:08.340 --> 56:09.100
so

56:09.100 --> 56:09.820
the password

56:09.820 --> 56:10.460
hasn't changed

56:10.460 --> 56:11.040
that's the main

56:11.040 --> 56:11.440
problem

56:11.440 --> 56:15.240
but here

56:15.240 --> 56:15.700
it says

56:15.700 --> 56:17.520
12

56:17.520 --> 56:18.200
I think

56:18.200 --> 56:19.060
I may be wrong

56:19.060 --> 56:19.360
it wasn't

56:19.360 --> 56:19.580
30

56:19.580 --> 56:20.240
I think

56:20.240 --> 56:20.660
it was even

56:20.660 --> 56:21.280
less

56:21.280 --> 56:21.760
it was 12

56:21.760 --> 56:22.080
bits

56:22.080 --> 56:22.620
originally

56:22.620 --> 56:23.580
well today

56:23.580 --> 56:24.000
12 bits

56:24.000 --> 56:24.520
is laughable

56:24.520 --> 56:24.740
right

56:24.740 --> 56:25.160
so what

56:25.160 --> 56:25.440
is it

56:25.440 --> 56:25.720
saying

56:25.720 --> 56:26.400
if the

56:26.400 --> 56:26.720
passwords

56:26.720 --> 56:27.200
come from

56:27.200 --> 56:27.420
I don't

56:27.420 --> 56:27.560
know

56:27.560 --> 56:28.060
2 to the

56:28.060 --> 56:28.340
20

56:28.340 --> 56:28.800
space

56:28.800 --> 56:29.660
and multiplied

56:29.660 --> 56:30.300
by 2 to the

56:30.300 --> 56:30.560
12

56:30.560 --> 56:30.920
you still

56:30.920 --> 56:31.380
get 2 to

56:31.380 --> 56:31.720
32

56:31.720 --> 56:32.640
which is

56:32.640 --> 56:33.100
a laughably

56:33.100 --> 56:33.760
small number

56:33.760 --> 56:34.780
or password

56:34.780 --> 56:35.140
bracket

56:35.140 --> 56:36.840
right

56:36.840 --> 56:37.340
it takes

56:37.340 --> 56:38.760
a minute

56:38.760 --> 56:39.180
or less

56:39.180 --> 56:40.620
to go for

56:40.620 --> 56:41.080
the 2 to the

56:41.080 --> 56:41.460
32

56:41.460 --> 56:42.380
password

56:42.380 --> 56:42.680
choice

56:42.680 --> 56:45.860
right

56:45.860 --> 56:46.140
so

56:46.140 --> 56:47.080
instead

56:47.080 --> 56:47.700
so

56:47.700 --> 56:48.640
what happens

56:48.640 --> 56:49.680
these days

56:49.680 --> 56:50.020
is that

56:50.020 --> 56:50.600
most systems

56:50.600 --> 56:51.020
actually

56:51.020 --> 56:52.260
kind of

56:52.260 --> 56:52.680
separate

56:52.680 --> 56:53.000
the two

56:53.000 --> 56:53.220
things

56:53.220 --> 56:53.640
they separate

56:53.640 --> 56:54.380
the password

56:54.380 --> 56:55.960
from

56:55.960 --> 56:57.520
the account

56:57.520 --> 56:58.080
information

56:58.080 --> 56:58.620
in Unix

56:58.620 --> 56:59.040
and that's

56:59.040 --> 56:59.240
kind of

56:59.240 --> 56:59.460
a good

56:59.460 --> 56:59.840
practice

56:59.840 --> 57:00.280
anyway

57:00.280 --> 57:01.880
so

57:01.880 --> 57:03.000
they create

57:03.000 --> 57:03.320
what's called

57:03.320 --> 57:03.700
shadow

57:03.700 --> 57:04.180
password

57:04.180 --> 57:05.000
and so

57:05.000 --> 57:05.800
instead of

57:05.800 --> 57:06.280
looking like

57:06.280 --> 57:06.800
what you saw

57:06.800 --> 57:07.320
before

57:07.320 --> 57:08.380
the account

57:08.380 --> 57:09.100
record

57:09.100 --> 57:09.540
in the

57:09.540 --> 57:09.800
etsy

57:09.800 --> 57:10.260
password

57:10.260 --> 57:10.720
file

57:10.720 --> 57:12.620
has

57:12.620 --> 57:13.820
the name

57:13.820 --> 57:14.760
and then

57:14.760 --> 57:15.220
all the other

57:15.220 --> 57:15.780
information

57:15.780 --> 57:16.180
but there's

57:16.180 --> 57:16.520
like an

57:16.520 --> 57:16.920
x

57:16.920 --> 57:18.180
following the

57:18.180 --> 57:18.700
accounting

57:18.700 --> 57:19.200
that says

57:19.200 --> 57:20.000
actual password

57:20.000 --> 57:20.540
isn't here

57:20.540 --> 57:21.660
it's a

57:21.660 --> 57:23.120
special

57:23.120 --> 57:24.260
hashed

57:24.260 --> 57:24.920
password file

57:24.920 --> 57:25.520
which is not

57:25.520 --> 57:26.180
world readable

57:26.180 --> 57:28.280
like it took

57:28.280 --> 57:29.400
only 30 years

57:29.400 --> 57:30.140
for people to realize

57:30.140 --> 57:31.340
that the passwords

57:31.340 --> 57:32.300
and user account

57:32.300 --> 57:32.780
information

57:32.780 --> 57:33.500
shouldn't be stored

57:33.500 --> 57:33.940
together

57:33.940 --> 57:36.760
well that's what

57:36.760 --> 57:37.100
happens

57:37.100 --> 57:37.340
right

57:37.340 --> 57:38.880
because all

57:38.880 --> 57:39.280
those other

57:39.280 --> 57:39.700
programs

57:39.700 --> 57:40.700
application programs

57:40.700 --> 57:41.180
running on

57:41.180 --> 57:41.800
this Unix

57:41.800 --> 57:42.400
like operating

57:42.400 --> 57:42.740
system

57:42.740 --> 57:43.680
they still

57:43.680 --> 57:44.120
do need

57:44.120 --> 57:44.580
the account

57:44.580 --> 57:45.120
information

57:45.120 --> 57:46.040
to figure out

57:46.040 --> 57:46.600
who can access

57:46.600 --> 57:46.980
what

57:46.980 --> 57:47.280
etc

57:47.280 --> 57:48.280
and distinguish

57:48.280 --> 57:48.920
between users

57:48.920 --> 57:49.300
but

57:49.300 --> 57:51.160
they don't

57:51.160 --> 57:51.480
need to know

57:51.480 --> 57:51.940
the passwords

57:51.940 --> 57:53.300
right

57:53.300 --> 57:53.660
so

57:53.660 --> 57:55.900
let's create

57:55.900 --> 57:56.620
a file

57:56.620 --> 57:57.160
that has

57:57.160 --> 57:57.800
all the account

57:57.800 --> 57:58.240
information

57:58.240 --> 57:58.880
that also

57:58.880 --> 57:59.480
store passwords

57:59.480 --> 57:59.700
in

57:59.700 --> 58:00.160
passwords

58:00.160 --> 58:00.600
should only

58:00.600 --> 58:01.000
be visible

58:01.000 --> 58:01.580
to the root

58:01.580 --> 58:02.220
or the admin

58:02.220 --> 58:02.600
account

58:02.600 --> 58:03.540
right

58:03.540 --> 58:04.020
so instead

58:04.020 --> 58:04.500
it's stored

58:04.500 --> 58:05.080
in an etsy

58:05.080 --> 58:05.900
shadow file

58:05.900 --> 58:06.840
which is only

58:06.840 --> 58:07.160
readable

58:07.160 --> 58:07.620
by the

58:07.620 --> 58:07.940
system

58:07.940 --> 58:08.420
administrator

58:08.420 --> 58:10.640
okay

58:10.640 --> 58:12.740
also

58:12.740 --> 58:13.480
very trivial

58:13.480 --> 58:13.860
thing

58:13.860 --> 58:15.040
and of course

58:15.040 --> 58:15.360
it also

58:15.360 --> 58:16.180
added expiration

58:16.180 --> 58:16.420
date

58:16.420 --> 58:16.940
for passwords

58:16.940 --> 58:17.220
right

58:17.220 --> 58:17.580
so that's

58:17.580 --> 58:18.500
why on

58:18.500 --> 58:19.620
most

58:19.620 --> 58:20.400
production

58:20.400 --> 58:21.200
Unix

58:21.200 --> 58:21.780
like systems

58:21.780 --> 58:22.200
you'll be

58:22.200 --> 58:22.540
asked to

58:22.540 --> 58:22.860
renew

58:22.860 --> 58:23.960
or

58:23.960 --> 58:25.960
change

58:25.960 --> 58:26.200
another

58:26.200 --> 58:26.540
password

58:26.540 --> 58:27.000
every so

58:27.000 --> 58:27.200
often

58:27.200 --> 58:30.300
okay

58:30.300 --> 58:30.760
so

58:30.760 --> 58:31.420
you've probably

58:31.420 --> 58:31.820
heard of

58:31.820 --> 58:32.320
keyloggers

58:32.320 --> 58:32.580
right

58:32.580 --> 58:35.700
so these

58:35.700 --> 58:36.120
are things

58:36.120 --> 58:36.600
you generally

58:36.600 --> 58:37.060
have to be

58:37.060 --> 58:37.740
afraid of

58:37.740 --> 58:39.980
not so much

58:39.980 --> 58:40.480
on your own

58:40.480 --> 58:40.980
devices

58:40.980 --> 58:41.580
because

58:41.580 --> 58:42.300
it's not

58:42.300 --> 58:42.780
all that

58:42.780 --> 58:43.100
easy

58:43.100 --> 58:43.680
to install

58:43.680 --> 58:44.220
a keylogger

58:44.220 --> 58:44.480
unless

58:44.480 --> 58:44.820
somebody

58:44.820 --> 58:45.000
has

58:45.000 --> 58:45.760
direct

58:45.760 --> 58:46.380
access

58:46.380 --> 58:46.760
and an

58:46.760 --> 58:47.100
account

58:47.100 --> 58:47.420
on your

58:47.420 --> 58:47.820
device

58:47.820 --> 58:48.360
but

58:48.360 --> 58:48.880
more like

58:48.880 --> 58:49.180
when you're

58:49.180 --> 58:49.400
using

58:49.400 --> 58:49.880
public

58:49.880 --> 58:51.500
facility

58:51.500 --> 58:51.980
like

58:51.980 --> 58:52.460
any of

58:52.460 --> 58:52.700
you ever

58:52.700 --> 58:52.960
use

58:52.960 --> 58:53.500
ICS

58:53.500 --> 58:54.060
terminals

58:54.060 --> 58:55.500
or ICS

58:55.500 --> 58:55.860
machines

58:55.860 --> 58:56.420
but that's

58:56.420 --> 58:56.680
where you

58:56.680 --> 58:56.920
have to

58:56.920 --> 58:57.280
be worried

58:57.280 --> 58:57.720
about

58:57.720 --> 58:58.280
because

58:58.280 --> 59:01.420
there you

59:01.420 --> 59:01.720
have no

59:01.720 --> 59:02.020
idea

59:02.020 --> 59:03.380
what software

59:03.380 --> 59:03.880
is running

59:03.880 --> 59:04.420
who has

59:04.420 --> 59:04.780
been there

59:04.780 --> 59:05.080
before

59:05.080 --> 59:05.260
you

59:05.260 --> 59:05.560
essentially

59:05.560 --> 59:06.180
these

59:06.180 --> 59:06.540
machines

59:06.540 --> 59:06.740
are

59:06.740 --> 59:08.500
sort of

59:08.500 --> 59:08.620
like

59:08.620 --> 59:08.960
public

59:08.960 --> 59:09.280
toilet

59:09.280 --> 59:09.860
you have

59:09.860 --> 59:10.380
no idea

59:10.380 --> 59:10.900
what's

59:10.900 --> 59:11.300
going on

59:11.300 --> 59:11.540
there

59:11.540 --> 59:12.460
and

59:12.460 --> 59:12.660
what

59:12.660 --> 59:12.800
is

59:12.800 --> 59:13.040
running

59:13.040 --> 59:13.260
there

59:13.260 --> 59:13.500
really

59:13.500 --> 59:15.880
so

59:15.880 --> 59:16.020
if

59:16.020 --> 59:16.180
these

59:16.180 --> 59:16.660
drugloggers

59:16.660 --> 59:16.900
are

59:16.900 --> 59:17.440
problem

59:17.440 --> 59:18.580
they

59:18.580 --> 59:19.080
can be

59:19.080 --> 59:19.520
hardware

59:19.520 --> 59:19.880
based

59:19.880 --> 59:20.020
or

59:20.020 --> 59:20.580
software

59:20.580 --> 59:21.020
based

59:21.020 --> 59:21.860
hardware

59:21.860 --> 59:22.160
based

59:22.160 --> 59:22.380
means

59:22.380 --> 59:22.640
somebody

59:22.640 --> 59:23.080
actually

59:23.080 --> 59:24.200
inserted

59:24.200 --> 59:25.860
something

59:25.860 --> 59:27.240
you

59:27.240 --> 59:27.400
know

59:27.400 --> 59:27.960
external

59:27.960 --> 59:28.400
keyboards

59:28.400 --> 59:28.760
not the

59:28.760 --> 59:28.920
kind

59:28.920 --> 59:29.200
you have

59:29.200 --> 59:29.560
right now

59:29.560 --> 59:29.840
in front

59:29.840 --> 59:30.000
of you

59:30.000 --> 59:30.160
but

59:30.160 --> 59:30.560
actual

59:30.560 --> 59:31.100
keyboards

59:31.100 --> 59:31.860
move on

59:31.860 --> 59:32.580
they have

59:32.580 --> 59:32.920
a wire

59:32.920 --> 59:35.180
some of them

59:35.180 --> 59:35.340
do

59:35.340 --> 59:35.700
some of them

59:35.700 --> 59:35.920
don't

59:35.920 --> 59:36.300
but most

59:36.300 --> 59:36.800
have a wire

59:36.800 --> 59:38.520
well

59:38.520 --> 59:39.460
the wire

59:39.460 --> 59:40.000
goes in the

59:40.000 --> 59:40.400
back of the

59:40.400 --> 59:40.680
computer

59:40.680 --> 59:41.040
somewhere

59:41.040 --> 59:41.380
or

59:41.380 --> 59:41.920
some

59:41.920 --> 59:42.900
USB

59:42.900 --> 59:43.940
interface

59:43.940 --> 59:44.860
well

59:44.860 --> 59:45.300
somebody

59:45.300 --> 59:45.560
could have

59:45.560 --> 59:46.360
installed

59:46.360 --> 59:46.700
something

59:46.700 --> 59:46.980
between

59:46.980 --> 59:47.460
the USB

59:47.460 --> 59:48.000
interface

59:48.000 --> 59:48.240
and the

59:48.240 --> 59:48.420
back

59:48.420 --> 59:48.620
of the

59:48.620 --> 59:48.840
computer

59:48.840 --> 59:49.280
you cannot

59:49.280 --> 59:49.560
see

59:49.560 --> 59:50.020
especially

59:50.020 --> 59:50.420
publicly

59:50.420 --> 59:52.380
and

59:52.380 --> 59:53.380
essentially

59:53.380 --> 59:54.440
it

59:54.440 --> 59:54.900
sees

59:54.900 --> 59:55.200
every

59:55.200 --> 59:55.600
keystroke

59:55.600 --> 59:55.920
you have

59:55.920 --> 59:58.260
okay

59:58.260 --> 59:59.460
some

59:59.460 --> 59:59.820
government

59:59.820 --> 01:00:00.320
computers

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.520
in various

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:01.940
agencies

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.500
do this

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.060
on purpose

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:03.620
they tell

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:04.060
employees

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:04.660
your

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.020
keystrokes

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:06.440
are locked

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:06.700
and there's

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.260
a keylogger

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.100
for

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:08.820
auditability

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:09.260
and logging

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:09.660
purposes

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.500
but

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.400
do you

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.060
yourself

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:13.620
whenever

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.160
you use

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:14.700
a public

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.440
or at least

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:15.980
not personal

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.400
but do you

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:16.840
have a look

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.940
to see

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:18.400
that the

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:18.740
wire

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.540
goes directly

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:19.860
into the

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:20.440
USB port

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:20.640
in the

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:20.860
back

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:21.060
of the

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:21.360
computer

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.200
or

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:22.460
there's

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:22.660
some

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:22.900
other

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:23.460
little

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:23.800
creepy

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.280
crawling

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:24.640
that

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:24.900
is in

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.260
between

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.740
I bet

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.120
most people

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:27.540
don't

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.320
with

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:29.960
wireless

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.580
oh

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.100
with wireless

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:32.820
it's even worse

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.200
because the

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:34.560
wireless

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.040
keyboard

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:35.640
typically

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.000
use

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.500
encryption

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.900
but the

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:38.180
kind of

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:38.480
encryption

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:38.800
you use

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.140
is often

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:39.820
homegrown

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:40.180
by the

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:40.660
manufacturer

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.060
or really

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:41.400
crappy

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.540
and so

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.500
you don't

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:44.840
need to

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.440
put a

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:45.760
hardware

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.280
device

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.580
you can

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.160
just sniff

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:48.680
on it

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.680
externally

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.060
right

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:51.340
because

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:51.700
they use

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:51.880
some

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:52.160
kind of

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.320
either

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:53.820
infrared

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:54.140
or some

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:54.320
other

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:54.460
kind

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:54.620
of

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.100
wireless

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:59.420
so

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.000
beware

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
but

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:02.760
attacks

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.660
keylogger

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.020
attacks

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:04.420
especially

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:04.920
hardware ones

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.160
are not

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:05.380
common

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:05.660
they are

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:06.100
targeted

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:06.420
right

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:06.740
somebody

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.000
has to

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:07.260
target

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:07.780
a specific

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.140
computer

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:08.560
a specific

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:08.980
person

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:09.640
in order

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:09.920
to do

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:10.100
that

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:10.820
software

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:11.340
keyloggers

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:11.780
are different

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:13.040
that often

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:13.420
happens

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.620
with buggy

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.200
browsers

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.540
or buggy

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:19.000
it used

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:19.340
to happen

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:19.840
once in

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.120
a while

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:20.720
with microsoft

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.240
windows

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.320
where there

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:22.580
would be

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.140
some malware

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:23.560
that would

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.320
warm itself

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:24.980
and usually

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.340
again

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:25.700
with some

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.080
degree of

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.840
social engineering

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.620
preceding it

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:28.660
and then

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.380
will

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:29.700
install

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:29.940
itself

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.320
and actually

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.100
take over

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.140
the keyboard

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.360
driver

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.220
or worse

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:35.400
yet

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:35.860
update

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:36.420
the keyboard

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:36.820
driver

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:37.080
right

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.300
because

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:37.740
the keyboard

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.080
is a

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:38.400
peripheral

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.140
right

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:39.800
there's a

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.100
driver

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:40.500
for that

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:40.900
peripheral

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:41.460
to

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.360
insert an

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.000
illegitimate

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.820
fake update

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:44.180
of the

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:44.540
driver

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.000
that would

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:46.340
contain

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.000
a keylogger

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.300
not nice

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.320
and then

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:49.700
there are

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.120
like

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:50.800
lower tech

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.480
ways of

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.000
sniffing

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:52.400
on

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.760
keyboard

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.260
input

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.320
shoulder

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:55.760
surfing

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.480
everybody

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:57.880
familiar

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.100
with

01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:58.320
shoulder

01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:58.640
surfing

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.260
yeah

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:00.700
people are

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:00.880
getting

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:01.380
too close

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.180
to you

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.100
too close

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:03.600
for comfort

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.960
you're entering

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.520
your pen

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.220
whether it's

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:06.500
on the

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:06.900
door

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.500
block

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:07.900
or

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:08.660
on your

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:08.940
bank

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:09.420
ATM

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:09.940
somebody's

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.080
like

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:10.380
breathing

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:10.680
down

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.120
your neck

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.220
that's

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:12.440
shoulder

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:12.800
surfing

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.520
I mean

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.040
easy to

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.440
avoid

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.400
but you have

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:17.580
to be

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:17.820
coming

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:18.100
center

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:18.400
right

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.140
but

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:19.380
shoulder

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:19.680
surfing

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.160
means that

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.460
human

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.700
eyes are

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:22.920
looking

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.260
at something

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:23.760
but it's not

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.240
always human

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:24.560
eyes

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.500
it could be

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.340
a tiny little

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:26.740
drone

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:28.200
it could be

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:28.700
a camera

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.300
from farther

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:30.680
away

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.000
with a

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:31.500
telephoto

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:31.840
lens

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.460
that is

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.720
shoulder

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.180
surfing

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.420
right

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.280
so

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.080
it could be

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:38.680
think about

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:38.800
it

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.420
you go

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:39.960
let's

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.080
say

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:40.420
let's

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:40.580
take

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:40.960
example

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.100
of

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:41.220
the

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:41.560
ATM

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.700
anybody

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:42.920
ever

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.080
go

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:43.200
to

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:43.280
the

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:43.540
ATM

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:43.860
anymore

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.980
I think

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.200
I go

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:46.460
once

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:46.680
twice

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:46.960
a year

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.560
but

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:48.940
still

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.200
people

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:49.420
do

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:49.840
I can

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.120
see you

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:50.400
every time

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:50.540
I go

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:50.740
to the

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:50.900
ATM

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:51.100
there

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:51.500
are

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:51.840
people

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.240
so

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.000
you don't

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.160
trip

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:53.500
in

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.940
do you know

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.180
how many

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:56.680
cameras are

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.040
looking at

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:57.160
you

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:57.440
well

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:57.660
there's

01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:58.000
a camera

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:58.380
in the

01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:58.720
ATM

01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:58.980
right

01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.360
they usually

01:02:59.360 --> 01:02:59.560
have

01:02:59.560 --> 01:02:59.840
a camera

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.700
but what

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:00.840
about

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.020
other

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.340
cameras

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:01.620
on the

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:01.820
street

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.580
do you

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:03.700
know

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:03.860
if

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.120
they have

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:04.240
the

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:04.400
right

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:04.700
angle

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.020
maybe

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:05.180
they

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:05.340
do

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:05.540
maybe

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:05.740
there's

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:05.980
something

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:06.200
right

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:06.480
above

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:06.660
you

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:06.920
that's

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.160
looking

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:07.660
directly

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:07.840
at

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:07.920
the

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.180
ATM

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:08.660
keypad

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.360
no

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.960
there are

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.240
thermal

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:13.700
cameras

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.940
that's

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:15.260
something

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.240
also

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:16.520
fairly

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:16.880
scary

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.880
thermal

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.300
cameras

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.260
what does

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:20.540
that mean

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.140
it means

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:22.100
when you

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:22.360
type

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:22.740
your

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.520
on

some

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.160
surface

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:25.420
like

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.120
keyboard

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:27.960
or

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.200
pin

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:28.440
tab

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.120
what

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:30.440
happens

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:30.620
is

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:30.820
your

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:31.280
fingers

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:31.860
touch

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.080
the

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:32.400
surface

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.300
you

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:34.400
are

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:34.780
human

you

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:37.140
were

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.080
checked

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:39.260
you

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:39.360
were

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:39.740
alive

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:40.240
which

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:40.580
means

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.140
as a

live

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.720
human

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.280
you have

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:43.540
a certain

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:44.020
temperature

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:44.480
on your

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:46.260
fingers

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.000
reflect that

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:47.380
temperature

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:48.380
and when

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:48.740
your

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:53.760
plastic

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.880
this

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.040
what

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:55.360
happens

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.840
heat

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.400
transfer

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.600
even

01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:58.800
if

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:58.880
you

01:03:58.880 --> 01:03:59.120
go

01:03:59.120 --> 01:03:59.600
boom

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.240
boom

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.360
well

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:01.640
that's

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.060
the force

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:02.380
right

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.320
that generates

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:04.600
heat

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:04.940
cut off

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:05.280
mainly

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:05.920

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.400
so

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.900
if

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:11.400
you

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.860
and

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:14.020
then

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:14.400
somebody

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:14.980
snaps

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:15.160
a

keyboard

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.340
they

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:19.540
will

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:19.940
see

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:20.920
heat

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.160
map

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.900
they

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:23.080
will

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:23.360
see

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:23.900
the

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.240
keys

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:24.460
that

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:24.680
won't

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:24.980
press

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:25.460
most

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:25.840
recently

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.180
they

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:27.480
might

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:27.860
not

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.520
directly

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.060
leak

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:29.740
pin

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:30.000
or

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:30.260
password

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:30.820
information

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.660
but

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:31.860
it

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.140
leaks

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:32.560
a lot

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.100
information

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:33.360
that's

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:33.640
about

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.180
in

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:35.680
particular

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.120
which

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:36.320
keys

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:36.480
were

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:36.720
pressed

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.080
recently

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:37.320
maybe

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:37.520
not

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:37.880
exactly

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.080
the

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:38.400
sequence

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:38.920
but

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:39.220
how many

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:39.600
combinations

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:39.880
that

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:39.940
are

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:40.760
right

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760
so

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.460
something to worry about

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.560
then there is something called acoustic emanation

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.020
there's a whole body of research literature on this

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.240
starting in like 25 years ago

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.480
people realize

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.680
people realize

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.500
that when you type on any surface

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.500
be it a keyboard

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:01.860
or a

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:02.040
thing

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.580
even on the phone

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.400
on the

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.620
on screen keyboard

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.820
there are sounds that are being named

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.680
and sound propagates

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:12.180
right

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.980
when you type

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.200
especially in some of those

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.040
people like me

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:16.300
etc

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:16.940
aggressive

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:17.340
times

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:20.140
sound propagates

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:20.540
farther

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.480
than the human ears

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:22.760
right

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.440
so if you put a very sensitive microphone

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.800
you know

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.840
ten yards away

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.100
people still pick up

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.500
keyboard emanations

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.660
isn't that scary

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.180
I think it's very cool

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:36.900
I have a lot of research on this

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.220
still these days

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.300
there are people who work at it

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:40.500
but

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.100
the sound

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.500
that your

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.140
fingers make

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.380
when you type in

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.100
anything

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.400
not just the classroom

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.100
is unique

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.000
not because

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:52.460
so much

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.420
that you make it

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:55.060
but the keyboard

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:55.520
itself

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.000
produces a different sound

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.620
for any different key

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:02.680
every key

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.800
on your plastic keyboard

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.060
makes a different sound

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:07.540
the same

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.740
to a lesser extent

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.020
old story about the keyboard

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:10.420
you have

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.760
but every time you press a key

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.060
the sound that it makes

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:15.800
when you press a Z

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.720
is different from the sound

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.280
that it makes you

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.040
when you press a D

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.060
or slash

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.140
or a question mark

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:20.640
or space

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.160
okay

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.420
there are different sounds

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.600
and so

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.880
if I record those sounds

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.260
I essentially can key log

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.500
without installing a key log

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.020
isn't that fun

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.620
but it gets worse

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.880
much worse

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.680
even if the manufacturers

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.820
and some made an effort

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:41.500
some didn't

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.220
to make all the keyboard

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:44.240
sounds sound the same

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.200
it's possible

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.640
it makes people

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.380
more expensive

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:51.540
there's still a problem

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.900
does anybody see the problem?

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.020
yourself as a person

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.480
what about yourself?

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.060
I mean

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:03.380
some people

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:05.280
have just

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.080
and they find

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:06.660
and they just

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:07.700
make themselves

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.280
because of the finger

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:09.640
and

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.080
uh-huh

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:10.960
yeah

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.240
yeah

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:11.940
so remember

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.440
it's true

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.080
that

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:14.980
what I said before

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.020
is that there's you

01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:17.820
who types differently

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.140
depending on which key you type

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.420
and then there's the actual keyboard

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.500
that makes different sounds

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.480
so even if you press

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.640
the same way

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.320
on the same

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.120
like

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.320
you have this finger

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.080
like you're one of those

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:29.780
hunter tech

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.160
people like me

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.300
like

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.420
you move the keyboard

01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:35.980
hit

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.940
move the keyboard

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:37.320
hit it

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:37.720
so you see

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.980
my angle doesn't change

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.040
so I hit the same way

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.000
right

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.400
but the keyboard sound

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:43.880
is different

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.840
but

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.860
manufacturers suppose

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:48.820
now fix the keyboard

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:49.620
that all the sounds

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.100
are the same

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.920
but I haven't changed

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.220
right

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.300
so

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:54.280
when I use my

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.780
this finger

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.840
that goes straight down

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:58.920
on this one letter

01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.900
it sounds one way

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.600
when I have to angle my finger

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.920
to press shift

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.000
right

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.680
or press question mark

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.680
it sounds differently

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.920
not because of the keyboard

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.220
but because of the way

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.720
I angle my fingers

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.820
and the force I apply

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:12.720
correct

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.580
but it gets worse than that

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.540
that

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:16.880
so

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.800
you can indeed

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.940
still mine the information

01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:19.380
like I said

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.740
about the individual

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.080
humans typing

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.040
characteristics

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:23.520
but

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.560
it's harder

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.380
it's harder

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.340
it's easier to extract

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.180
from the manufacturer

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:27.780
introduced

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.560
distinction

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.360
though

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.100
the problem is

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:30.960
what did you say

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.320
time

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.340
like time between keys

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.160
time between keys

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:33.900
that's the problem

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:35.200
turns out

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.120
on a standard

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.240
QWERTY keyboard

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:37.880
let's assume

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.920
that we're using

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.560
QWERTYs

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:39.800
right

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.540
which is an American

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:41.060
keyboard

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:44.480
as you move

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.680
from key to key

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.740
right

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.720
from let's say

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.340
typing key

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.180
to typing H

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:51.940
to typing E

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:52.800
to typing N

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:53.500
to typing E

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.280
to typing X

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.060
to typing E

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.000
right

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:57.960
you type one letter

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.420
at a time

01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.120
even if you are

01:08:59.120 --> 01:08:59.680
touch typist

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.580
you type one letter

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.100
at a time

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:01.700
well

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.080
the intervals

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.060
the timing intervals

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.660
between successive letters

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.340
are unique to you

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.160
also

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.420
and the keyboard

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:10.180
they sound like

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:10.660
that's right

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.740
they're slightly different

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:12.000
yeah

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.460
yeah

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:12.800
but

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.680
that's right

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:14.940
they sound

01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:15.560
that's true

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.180
but that's actually

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:16.980
related more

01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:17.600
to what he said

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.100
but just

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.420
the sheer timings

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.600
between the keystrokes

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.640
so you don't have

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.620
to have any idea

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:24.980
but

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.380
guess what

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:26.940
there are

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:27.620
let's say

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:28.600
forget the

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.500
exclamation points

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.000
forget those

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:30.660
special characters

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:31.280
let's suppose

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:31.620
there are

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:32.100
I don't know

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.100
26 keys

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:33.580
on the keyboard

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:34.880
and you're just

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:35.960
typing words

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.260
right

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.520
so how many

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:38.960
possible

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.520
two word

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.060
combinations

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:40.480
are there

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:40.880
two letter

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.220
combinations

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:41.500
are there

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.420
26 times 26

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:42.800
right

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.560
so after a while

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:44.920
if you

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.340
record

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.260
the sounds

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:47.680
of somebody

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.080
typing

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.020
a lot of text

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:49.280
right

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:49.980
over the day

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:50.740
or two days

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:51.140
or whatever

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.100
you're going to

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.040
start distinguishing

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.500
between transitions

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.320
between keys

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:55.720
right

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.040
believe me

01:09:59.040 --> 01:09:59.940
it's totally doable

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.660
because

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.000
assuming

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:03.460
somebody

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:03.980
is typing

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:04.920
English text

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:05.240
right

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:05.820
like writing

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:06.700
email messages

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.900
or filling out

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:08.420
forms

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:09.460
well

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:11.420
the probability

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.120
of occurrence

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.260
of two successive

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.220
letters

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.820
are quite distinct

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.000
and essentially

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:17.400
becomes

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.460
a simple

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:18.740
decision

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:19.840
so anyway

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.460
that was a little

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:20.920
detour

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.700
but what about

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.420
good vibrations

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.400
well good vibrations

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.240
refers to another

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:24.680
thing that

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.480
actually

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.680
if you're using

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.220
your phone

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:27.980
and that has

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:28.480
been some

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.260
published research

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:29.620
on this

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.280
and your phone

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:31.840
is like this

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:32.480
on your

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.060
desk

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.000
or whatever

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:35.820
in front of you

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:36.040
right

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:36.720
and

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.040
as you press

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:38.600
every

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.840
on-screen

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.560
button

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:40.820
right

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.560
on-screen keyboard

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.780
your phone

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:43.420
makes like a tiny

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.200
vibration sound

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.840
like a moment

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:46.340
that the other

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:46.840
phone do

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:47.120
right

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.380
just to confirm

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:48.880
that you actually

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.520
type

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.680
well

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.260
those vibrations

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.520
when you put a

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:54.880
microphone

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.520
underneath your

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:55.960
desk

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.720
they can actually

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.480
calculate your

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:57.740
typing

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:02.400
other analysis

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.180
include taking

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:03.800
photos of

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.900
smartphone screens

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.340
and looking for

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.820
quadrants

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:08.540
little areas

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:09.240
on your screen

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.500
that are

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.300
most

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.480
like smudged

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.840
that

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.900
leaks information

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.640
about your

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.700
password

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.980
or the

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:19.800
unlock pattern

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.100
you know

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:20.300
this

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:20.700
like

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:21.580
anybody use

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:22.160
unlock patterns

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.980
like five years

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:24.200
ago

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.600
everybody in this

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:25.880
class

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.220
was like

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:26.580
yes

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:27.740
I guess

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:27.980
they are

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:28.580
faster now

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:29.840
but apparently

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:30.440
you know

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.380
if your human

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.760
fingers leave

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:33.400
like oil

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.400
residue

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.180
on the screen

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:36.340
and so

01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:36.980
if you take

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:37.600
a high resolution

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.160
photo of

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:38.580
somebody's

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:39.480
smartphone screen

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.660
you've got to

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.080
figure out

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:41.440
what the

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.060
unlock pattern

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:42.340
is

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.880
yeah

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.220
so all this

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:46.880
is good stuff

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.420
but the problem

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:49.020
is of course

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:49.440
like that

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:49.960
the passwords

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.340
right

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:51.720
why do I

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.260
talk about

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:52.660
all this

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.120
previous stuff

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:53.780
because that

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.080
would be

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:54.740
not only just

01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:55.180
a way of

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:55.800
snoop on

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:56.140
what you're

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:56.400
doing

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:56.880
but of course

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.380
to snoop on

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:57.820
your passwords

01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:58.740
right

01:11:58.740 --> 01:11:59.240
that's the way

01:11:59.240 --> 01:11:59.640
to actually

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.660
and sort of

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:01.080
learn your

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:01.360
password

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.780
the worst

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:03.480
thing we can

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.020
do is write

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:04.480
them down

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.260
because then

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.520
writing them

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:06.800
down

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.780
whether it's

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.780
on a device

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:09.300
or a piece

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:09.660
of paper

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:10.300
that becomes

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.980
a way to

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:12.500
like cause

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:12.900
denial of

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.200
service

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:13.540
etc

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:14.820
we can

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:15.400
pick passwords

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:15.660
that are

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:15.980
easy to

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:16.460
remember

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:20.480
some places

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:20.920
don't even

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.580
have passwords

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:22.080
I've seen

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:22.640
a few

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.640
systems

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.140
websites
