1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
I'm Drew Zee, if you don't die, no excuses.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,220
Now, let's share a quick show of hands.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,240
Do you want me to post a few example problems?

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,060
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,640
From prior years?

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:14,600
Yes.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,740
Let me ask this.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,960
How many don't want them?

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,840
I'll throw it together, a few examples.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,900
But I won't post solutions.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,240
Because many of the type of exams I give in classes I teach

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,060
generally have more than one solution.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,480
Rarely there's just one.

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,080
It's like for undergrad when I teach crypto,

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,240
there's just one solution.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,940
It's a numeric answer.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,960
But other than that, the type of questions you have,

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,980
that will require one, maximum two paragraph answers.

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:56,500
Okay?

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,420
Do not write me an essay.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,280
Okay?

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:00,960
Please.

23
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,180
Save yourself, save me.

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,100
Don't write an essay.

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,400
Okay?

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,420
Also, just as a rule,

27
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,380
there are no devices allowed in the essay.

28
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,440
The phones, calculators,

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,620
everything that you normally bring

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,700
has to be inside your backpack

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,500
or somewhere else away from you.

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,700
Okay?

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,660
No virtual reality AR type devices like this one.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:30,780
Okay?

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,140
No earphones.

36
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,480
No headphones.

37
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,080
Right?

38
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,060
None of that.

39
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,400
No smart devices whatsoever on your body

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,720
at the time of your exam.

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,960
Nice.

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,200
So your backpack, whatever stuff,

43
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,860
inside, next to you, under you, whatever.

44
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,540
No problem.

45
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,380
Okay?

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,660
You need to bring something to write with.

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,000
Pen?

48
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,100
Pencil?

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:54,980
Both?

50
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:56,940
Sure.

51
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,260
Okay?

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,580
I will give you paper.

53
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,660
I know.

54
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,360
It's old-fashioned.

55
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,340
It's 20th century.

56
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,720
You write it on paper.

57
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,080
Okay?

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,540
I will give you an exam sheet.

59
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,540
You will have some number of problems.

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,600
Not too large.

61
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,300
Not too small.

62
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,500
Same rules apply to the final type.

63
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,240
And you will have blank sheets of paper

64
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,100
that I will bring.

65
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,360
And I will give you a couple to start with.

66
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
If you need more, you'll come up.

67
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,600
Make some up.

68
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,880
You can write on one side or both sides.

69
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,380
I don't care.

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,800
The only thing I absolutely care

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,700
is that you do your best penmanship.

72
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,720
I am not here to decipher encrypted text.

73
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,340
It's not what I paid for.

74
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,860
That's beyond my call of duty.

75
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,720
So, if I can't read it,

76
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,520
I'll assume it's not decipherable

77
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,320
and it requires a deduction of points.

78
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,120
I mean, I don't want to be calling everybody in

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,420
and saying,

80
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,440
what did you mean here?

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,840
What is this encrypted word?

82
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,480
What is it in scrambled sentence?

83
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,280
Please, write legibly.

84
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,540
If you have to print,

85
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,000
use printed letters.

86
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,520
I don't care.

87
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,360
Just write legend.

88
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,300
Okay?

89
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,240
And if you erase,

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,380
make sure you erase well

91
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,700
because sometimes, you know,

92
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,760
when you erase something,

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,960
it's smudgy

94
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,340
and then you write on top of it

95
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,100
and then it's hard to read.

96
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,120
I'll give you more paper.

97
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,300
No problem.

98
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,500
Okay?

99
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,640
So, that's the exam

100
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,260
and it will cover everything we covered

101
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,560
including today.

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
I might ask you questions

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,240
about the background stuff

104
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,660
from that,

105
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,940
remember that lecture one background?

106
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,360
Why, like, not specific?

107
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,720
Like, not in big detail, right?

108
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,480
It's not relevant to what we covered.

109
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,800
Otherwise, so far,

110
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,800
I won't ask you, like,

111
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,340
how does elliptic curve DSA work?

112
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,740
So, I'll be reasonable

113
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,180
and you'll try to be reasonable.

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:02,720
Yeah?

115
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,520
Are we going to expect

116
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,120
to know, like,

117
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,940
the specific numbers

118
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,200
associated with different protocols?

119
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,980
What do you think?

120
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,340
I don't know.

121
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,620
I'm not happy.

122
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,120
No.

123
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,320
No.

124
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,020
If I ask you something like,

125
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,300
okay, so how does,

126
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,540
let's say today's lecture

127
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,980
was more about IPsec.

128
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,900
So, I'll say,

129
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,740
how does IPsec parse headers?

130
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,900
You should know how it does it

131
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,780
but you don't need to know

132
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,040
the vertical numbers

133
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,020
and, you know,

134
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,860
this kind of thing.

135
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,560
That's minutia.

136
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,820
I don't care about that.

137
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,700
I do not hear.

138
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,000
You're not here to, like,

139
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,500
for growth learning

140
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,320
to memorize some boring numbers,

141
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,600
you know.

142
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,800
Okay, so, on the last episode

143
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,220
of 203,

144
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,840
we went for SSL-TLS

145
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,880
and I know you're probably

146
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,520
more confused than you were before

147
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,320
but you do know a bit more about it

148
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,240
than you knew before.

149
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,280
It is a complicated protocol.

150
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,280
Nobody learns SSL-TLS

151
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,140
in one lecture.

152
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,340
Okay?

153
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,820
It's an effort that took years

154
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,980
by a whole lot of people,

155
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,580
smart people, right, mostly.

156
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,440
people with degrees

157
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,480
and experience

158
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,880
and security experts

159
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,760
to put together this protocol

160
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,200
and to evolve.

161
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,180
So, don't expect to, like,

162
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,560
understand everything

163
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,520
in one lecture

164
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,280
or even two.

165
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,320
What I give you here

166
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,420
in almost every lecture

167
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,820
is essentially

168
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,880
an appetizer

169
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,300
and if you're interested

170
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,260
in the meal,

171
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,420
you go further

172
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,460
and do a dig on your own.

173
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,160
Okay?

174
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,900
So, you will know

175
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,080
just enough to be dangerous.

176
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,500
but it's not enough

177
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,660
to be any kind of an expert.

178
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,480
So, remember,

179
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,200
what the key things

180
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,240
about SSL

181
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,760
and SSL-TLS

182
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,200
is that they operate

183
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,900
at this thin sublayer

184
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,760
above transport.

185
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,520
They are primarily oriented

186
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
towards the web

187
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,060
or HTTP traffic

188
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,040
but not exclusively.

189
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,200
People use SSL-TLS

190
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,220
for other things.

191
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,100
But the biggest consumer

192
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,740
is the web traffic.

193
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:21,200
So, we covered

194
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,220
the handshake, right?

195
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:22,760
Remember

196
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,300
the handshake protocol?

197
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:24,920
Right?

198
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,720
That's the main

199
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,380
thing about CLS

200
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,340
is without the handshake

201
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,240
nothing else works.

202
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,360
The handshake protocol

203
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,460
is very important.

204
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,160
It is

205
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,260
a full handshake

206
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,920
meaning that

207
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,040
it requires

208
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,160
an initiator,

209
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,720
the client,

210
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,080
to send something first

211
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,800
usually not authenticated

212
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,040
because the first message

213
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,940
cannot be authenticated

214
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,160
if there's no prior

215
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,700
contact.

216
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,360
And then the server replies

217
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,420
also with usually

218
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,940
not authenticated message

219
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,700
saying,

220
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,060
here's my certificate

221
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,980
and then the server

222
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,560
already computes

223
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,180
a session ID

224
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,820
because remember

225
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,000
the client supplies

226
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,880
a random number

227
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,380
a nonce

228
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,240
in the first message

229
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,920
client hello

230
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,400
the server replies

231
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,300
with a certificate

232
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,420
and the server hello

233
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,260
and that contains

234
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,760
a nonce.

235
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,700
So, given the two nonces

236
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
and some other stuff

237
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,900
they have a session ID

238
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,860
so they can identify

239
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,040
this particular session

240
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,360
between this client

241
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,040
and this server.

242
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,400
Okay?

243
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,560
And recall that

244
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,400
99%

245
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,720
more than 99%

246
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,220
of the cases

247
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,180
client authentication

248
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,380
isn't done

249
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,620
in SSL TLS.

250
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,680
It can be done

251
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,900
but it isn't done

252
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,300
for reasons

253
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,260
that I already discussed.

254
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,340
Right?

255
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,200
And

256
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,000
most of the time

257
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,440
today

258
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,120
you will see

259
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,780
that most

260
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,400
key exchange

261
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,720
right?

262
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:49,860
Not

263
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,180
right?

264
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,700
Key exchange

265
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,060
is done

266
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,820
using RSA

267
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,820
where the client

268
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,800
picks what's called

269
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,880
pre-master secret

270
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,220
encrypts it

271
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,180
using the server's

272
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,780
public key

273
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,800
all this is

274
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,680
after you check

275
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,580
the server certificate

276
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:00,960
right?

277
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,140
You don't do this

278
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,320
right?

279
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,280
The client abandons

280
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,780
the protocol

281
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,760
if there's something

282
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,340
wrong with the

283
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,000
server certificate.

284
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,860
Do you remember that?

285
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,400
Yes?

286
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,600
So the idea

287
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,980
in security protocols

288
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,800
is you don't

289
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,280
do heavy work

290
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,940
before you do

291
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,620
light work.

292
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,100
So the light work

293
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,240
means you make sure

294
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,840
that the server name

295
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,420
in the certificate

296
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,700
matches the URL

297
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,560
the domain name

298
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,180
of the URL.

299
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,600
Otherwise

300
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,740
you're being phished

301
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,800
and attacked.

302
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,220
Okay?

303
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,140
You're being scammed.

304
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,880
So test the map.

305
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,840
Of course

306
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,880
it doesn't help you

307
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,220
if you mistyped the name.

308
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,780
If you went

309
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,640
wanted to go to

310
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,780
wellsbargo.com

311
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,500
and you typed

312
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,960
wellsbargo.com

313
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,100
well guess what?

314
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,020
If somebody

315
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,740
if somebody

316
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,640
has a website

317
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,300
called wellsbargo.com

318
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,260
and registered it

319
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,340
and has a certificate

320
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,380
that's where you're

321
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,720
going to go

322
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,660
and SSL TLS

323
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,620
will not help you.

324
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,420
It doesn't sound

325
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,020
too good

326
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,380
does it?

327
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,120
That's called

328
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,700
that kind of attack

329
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,020
was called

330
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,840
type of squatting

331
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,160
where

332
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,460
adversaries

333
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,420
or sometimes

334
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,280
not even adversaries

335
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,160
are like

336
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,360
porn sites

337
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,100
or like

338
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,600
marketing sites

339
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,300
will set up

340
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,640
a domain name

341
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,980
a domain name

342
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,740
that closely

343
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,620
resembles a

344
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,100
legitimate

345
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,800
well-known

346
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,500
domain name

347
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,400
hoping that

348
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:23,860
the users

349
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,160
will mistype

350
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,900
the name

351
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,220
and they will

352
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,820
land on their

353
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,120
site.

354
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,480
In the worst case

355
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,940
you will see

356
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,840
some questionable

357
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,340
content

358
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,520
or you know

359
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,720
a walking tub

360
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,620
will be advertised

361
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:36,960
to you

362
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,620
by Akron.

363
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,760
In the worst case

364
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,640
you'll be fished.

365
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay?

366
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,600
Meaning that

367
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
they will present

368
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,900
to you something

369
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,540
that looks like

370
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,480
a wellsbargo page

371
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,140
and you'll

372
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,680
blindly

373
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,460
most people

374
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:49,980
blindly

375
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,640
type their

376
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,120
username

377
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,620
and password

378
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,560
and that's it.

379
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,740
Bye-bye.

380
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,120
And so

381
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,820
SSLTLS

382
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,400
won't help you

383
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,740
with this

384
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,920
but if you

385
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,100
click

386
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,800
let's say

387
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,440
on a bookmark

388
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,060
that you put

389
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,940
a long time ago

390
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,280
that says

391
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,380
wellsbargo.com

392
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,600
SSLTLS

393
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,200
will help you

394
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,500
because there's

395
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,080
no typos

396
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,440
right?

397
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,100
Right.

398
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,280
So most

399
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,660
common

400
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,640
in

401
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,720
TLS

402
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,160
before

403
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,400
version 1.3

404
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,740
remember

405
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,260
I told you

406
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,680
there's like

407
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,120
two real

408
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,500
versions

409
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,940
out there

410
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,300
today

411
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,060
there's

412
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,280
really

413
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,300
TLS 1.2

414
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,060
and 1.3

415
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,620
they probably

416
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,000
used

417
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,560
the most

418
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,000
there are

419
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,100
lower versions

420
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,820
older versions

421
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,500
still in use

422
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,040
but they're

423
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,880
being deprecated

424
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,960
so a lot

425
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,920
of web

426
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,380
servers

427
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,220
will simply

428
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,960
not accept

429
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,700
a conversation

430
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,620
and TLS

431
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:40,980
session

432
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,660
with a client

433
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,400
that does

434
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,960
not support

435
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,340
at least

436
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,120
1.2

437
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,040
TLS

438
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,460
now 1.2

439
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,120
and 1.3

440
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,500
differ

441
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,000
I already

442
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,920
alluded to

443
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,220
that

444
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,340
but my

445
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,900
discussion

446
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,280
last time

447
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,120
was focused

448
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,960
on 1.2

449
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,840
so in

450
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,680
1.3

451
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,320
unlike here

452
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,480
you can

453
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,980
no longer

454
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,880
use RSA

455
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,440
to encrypt

456
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,920
okay

457
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,360
in 1.3

458
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,220
you have to

459
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:09,920
basically use

460
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,480
signatures

461
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,500
and use

462
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,160
Diffie-Hellman

463
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,600
or something

464
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,180
similar to

465
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,700
Diffie-Hellman

466
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,600
for key exchange

467
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,240
you cannot use

468
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,800
RSA

469
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,620
for key exchange

470
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,640
right

471
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,500
we looked at

472
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,020
how key is

473
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,540
derived

474
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:23,940
right

475
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,540
because remember

476
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:24,880
there's

477
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,920
pre-master secret

478
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,460
then there's

479
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,780
like a

480
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,500
master secret

481
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,100
well

482
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,420
in TLS 1.3

483
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,040
I believe

484
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,540
there's no

485
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,780
pre-master secret

486
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,620
because actually

487
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,540
both sides

488
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,180
contribute to

489
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,580
the key

490
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,520
and compute

491
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:35,900
what's called

492
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,620
the master secret

493
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,600
because Diffie-Hellman

494
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,280
is symmetric

495
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,360
symmetric

496
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,200
meaning both sides

497
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,000
contribute equally

498
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,280
and then

499
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,160
using the master

500
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,580
secret

501
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,220
we derive

502
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,700
using

503
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,960
something called

504
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,900
the k-derivation

505
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,360
function

506
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,640
a set of

507
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,160
other keys

508
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,400
right

509
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,000
that we actually

510
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,620
use for

511
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,020
encryption

512
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,660
and authentication

513
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,100
during the

514
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,220
data transfer

515
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,260
okay

516
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,980
we looked at

517
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,420
this

518
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:00,920
this

519
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,240
this

520
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,380
and then

521
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,600
there was

522
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,000
a summary

523
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,320
right

524
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,940
we stopped

525
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,440
around here

526
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,900
no

527
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,280
this is a

528
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,620
summary

529
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,060
of

530
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,960
a

531
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,440
handshake

532
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,520
client

533
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,900
below

534
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,600
followed by

535
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,740
three messages

536
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,780
essentially put

537
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,220
together

538
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,900
server hello

539
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,180
server

540
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,800
certificate

541
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,240
change

542
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,700
server hello

543
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,040
down

544
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,840
then

545
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,220
client returns

546
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,600
to server

547
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:22,880
saying

548
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,360
okay

549
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,100
this is client

550
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,700
key exchange

551
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,200
message

552
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,660
right

553
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,420
so now

554
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,020
that message

555
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,780
can be secured

556
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,220
already

557
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,180
client finished

558
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,640
by the way

559
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,160
contains

560
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,800
in mac

561
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,960
of all

562
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,140
of everything

563
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,300
exchanged so far

564
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,400
computed

565
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,260
with a key

566
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,940
that they just

567
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,400
agree on

568
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,340
master secret

569
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,660
key

570
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,880
and the last

571
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,480
message in the

572
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:41,840
exchange

573
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,280
is server

574
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,080
goes to client

575
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,380
says confirming

576
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,220
that we selected

577
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,560
this

578
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,400
I mean this

579
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,380
wording is confusing

580
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,720
change

581
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,380
they're not changing

582
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,920
any cyphers

583
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,140
today

584
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,180
right

585
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,940
they already agreed

586
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,600
on what cyphers

587
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,980
they use

588
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,380
important one

589
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,760
is server

590
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,160
finished

591
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,920
that can also

592
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,300
contain

593
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,800
a mac

594
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,140
of all the

595
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,820
messages exchanged

596
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,740
from the

597
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,020
service

598
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,440
perspective

599
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,460
so if the

600
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,080
survey of the

601
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,680
client have

602
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,300
the same view

603
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,760
of messages

604
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,520
sent and received

605
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,360
that means

606
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,160
no one

607
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,400
has interfered

608
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,640
with the

609
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:08,980
protocol

610
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,340
not a single

611
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:11,740
bit has

612
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,340
changed

613
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,280
then they're

614
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,940
sure that

615
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,380
they're talking

616
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:14,960
to each other

617
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,380
and that

618
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,060
completes the

619
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,400
handshake

620
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:23,060
we talked

621
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,700
about this

622
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:32,380
talking about

623
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,820
this

624
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,400
there's some

625
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,820
options

626
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,700
yes

627
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,300
so the other

628
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:37,800
thing you can

629
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,140
do

630
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,880
is if

631
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,300
client and

632
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,880
server have

633
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,500
previously

634
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,700
established

635
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,880
SSL-TLS

636
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,300
connection

637
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,520
there is already

638
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,280
a session ID

639
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,800
remember there

640
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,620
was a session ID

641
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,000
derived

642
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,800
that identified

643
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,080
the SSL-TLS

644
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,600
connection

645
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,740
the client

646
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,880
can resume

647
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,820
the connection

648
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,800
yeah

649
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
resume

650
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,120
means

651
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,200
hey

652
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,900
I'm still

653
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,220
here

654
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,500
I'm still

655
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:03,800
here

656
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,780
there's two

657
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,140
purposes

658
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,500
for that

659
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,140
this one's

660
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,600
kind of like

661
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,820
saying I'm

662
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,080
around

663
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,480
don't

664
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:09,700
don't

665
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:09,940
don't

666
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,200
flush

667
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,660
the state

668
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:10,900
right

669
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,260
I'm still

670
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,580
here

671
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,440
and the

672
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,940
other one

673
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,400
is

674
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,920
the other

675
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,360
purpose

676
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,920
is

677
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,460
oh

678
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,040
let's

679
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,280
change

680
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,540
keys

681
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:17,840
let's

682
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,280
refresh

683
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,620
key

684
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,380
okay

685
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,040
so

686
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,400
if you

687
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,940
have

688
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,680
what's called

689
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,500
session resumption

690
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:24,760
right

691
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,340
you can

692
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,060
essentially

693
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,820
maintain the

694
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,220
same

695
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,260
not have to

696
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,720
redo the

697
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,120
handshake

698
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,440
right

699
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:30,940
you can

700
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,600
maintain the

701
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:31,860
same

702
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,620
master secret

703
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,280
but the

704
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,860
nonsense can

705
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,260
change

706
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,320
remember

707
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,640
nonsense

708
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:36,920
these

709
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,440
randoms

710
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,860
they can

711
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,160
change

712
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,060
and so

713
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,020
the actual

714
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,500
encryption keys

715
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,040
and authentication

716
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,000
keys will change

717
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,480
as a result

718
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,000
you can

719
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,420
theoretically

720
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,100
also change

721
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,900
the cipher suite

722
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,740
at that point

723
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,760
most of the time

724
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,400
that doesn't happen

725
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,800
but you can

726
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:50,980
change

727
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,420
say ah

728
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,120
we'll be using

729
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,820
I don't know

730
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,380
RSA

731
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,720
with

732
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,500
AES

733
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,040
let's switch

734
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,440
to something

735
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,680
else

736
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,360
you could do

737
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,580
that

738
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,440
if the

739
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,200
policy allows

740
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,680
if both

741
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,040
sides

742
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,320
agree

743
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,620
you can

744
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:01,740
do

745
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,280
never mind

746
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,720
this

747
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,760
so

748
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,660
the main

749
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm not going

750
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,600
to go in

751
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,300
such detail

752
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,400
over 1.3

753
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,840
it is actually

754
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,600
in some ways

755
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,180
a simpler

756
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,720
protocol

757
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,620
let's

758
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,300
zoom

759
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,020
on this

760
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,700
this is a

761
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,080
handshake

762
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,060
so what we've

763
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,800
seen is this

764
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,600
right

765
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,420
the first

766
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,380
four messages

767
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,320
are the handshake

768
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,980
and then you get

769
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,760
the HTTP

770
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,100
get

771
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,520
HTTP

772
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,000
right

773
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,580
because this

774
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:35,960
is what you

775
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,360
really want

776
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,620
right

777
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:36,980
you want

778
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,000
to fetch

779
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,440
a URL

780
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,780
so this

781
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,900
and this

782
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,220
gives you

783
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,440
like

784
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,040
this timeline

785
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,420
gives you

786
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:43,840
approximate

787
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,160
like

788
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,960
for comparison

789
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,680
an average

790
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,140
timeline

791
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,180
for how long

792
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,520
it takes

793
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,200
so if you look

794
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,380
at

795
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,420
it starts

796
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:49,980
with 0

797
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,400
and

798
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,800
it's 200

799
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,440
milliseconds

800
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,240
until you get

801
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,540
here

802
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,060
okay

803
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,520
that's two

804
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,100
round trips

805
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,540
and that's

806
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,120
pure overhead

807
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,700
and so now

808
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,420
it's pure overhead

809
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,240
as far as

810
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,800
the user

811
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,820
is concerned

812
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,280
and then the

813
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,700
real useful

814
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,160
stuff is

815
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,880
get and put

816
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,160
right

817
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,760
here

818
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,460
now with

819
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,760
version 1.3

820
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,820
there's just

821
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,800
one round trip

822
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,740
and then

823
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,660
two packets

824
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,540
plan

825
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,100
hello

826
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,720
key share

827
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,460
and then

828
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:24,740
server

829
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,020
hello

830
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,420
key share

831
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:25,900
certificate

832
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,340
certificate

833
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:26,660
verify

834
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,240
blah blah blah

835
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,400
blah blah

836
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,180
okay

837
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,660
we're not going

838
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:28,840
to go

839
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,180
through the exact

840
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,540
format

841
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,100
but

842
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,920
essentially

843
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,400
the time

844
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,920
is cut in

845
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,280
half

846
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,480
with pretty

847
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,780
much

848
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,280
the same

849
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,800
result

850
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,380
that the

851
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,900
two parties

852
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,800
there's still

853
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,360
a handshake

854
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,780
it's just

855
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,760
a two message

856
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,240
handshake

857
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,780
not a four

858
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,100
message

859
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,560
handshake

860
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,800
and it's

861
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,420
faster

862
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:44,880
obviously

863
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,140
right

864
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,700
so 100

865
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,180
milliseconds

866
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,920
you might

867
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,780
not really

868
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,120
care

869
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,800
but over

870
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,200
time

871
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,060
this adds up

872
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,260
right

873
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:51,660
for many

874
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,120
users

875
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,800
over time

876
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,080
right

877
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,360
a lot of

878
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,760
traffic

879
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,620
a lot of

880
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:55,980
delays

881
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,340
so cutting

882
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:57,820
things in

883
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,220
half is

884
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,520
better

885
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,060
you had a

886
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,300
question

887
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,420
what's the

888
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:01,960
improvement

889
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,340
that

890
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,020
okay

891
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,180
many

892
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,880
there are

893
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,180
a number

894
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,820
of improvements

895
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,020
one of the

896
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,400
things is

897
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,120
simplification

898
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,940
so

899
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,220
TLS

900
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
1.2

901
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,760
and B4

902
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,080
they have

903
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,740
way too

904
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:13,940
many

905
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,640
cipher suites

906
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,920
some of

907
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,160
them

908
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,320
got deprecated

909
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:17,900
because they

910
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,540
were like

911
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,720
RC4

912
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,600
is a

913
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:20,940
cipher

914
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,460
MD5

915
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,800
a hash

916
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,240
function

917
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,820
they are

918
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,140
broken

919
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,100
or at least

920
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,540
they are

921
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:26,940
no longer

922
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,340
secure

923
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,440

924
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,420

secure

929
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,640
or too

930
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,120
expensive

931
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,680
I forget

932
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,980
exactly

933
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,180
yeah

934
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,460
I think

935
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,600
it's

936
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:34,900

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,200

secure

939
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,160
so

940
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,980
most of

941
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,200
the

943
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,720
today

944
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
you

945
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,280

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,520
see

955
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,140
you

956
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,220
will

957
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,420
see

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,900
SHA-256

959
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,080
you

960
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,280
will

961
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,500
not

anymore

965
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,920
so

966
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,520
rather than

967
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,080
hundreds

968
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,540
of

cipher suites

970
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,040
I think

971
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,520
the

972
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,720
main ones

973
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,100
are like

974
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,040
five or six

975
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,320
today

976
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,420
and

977
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:00,980
they're not

978
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,720
using RSA

979
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,220
anymore

980
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,700
so

981
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,900
also

982
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,440
the names

983
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,700
of the

984
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,180
cipher suites

985
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,460
changed

986
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:05,620

987
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:05,860
I remember

988
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,260
I was showing

989
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,580

990
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,640
TLS

995
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,020

996
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,900
the first

997
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,120

998
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,340

1001
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:13,980

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,420
tell you

1003
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,740
is

1004
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,460
how

1005
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:15,740
are we

1008
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,120
which is

1009
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,420
how

1010
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,000
RSA

1011
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,300

1013
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,000

1026
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,100
also

1027
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,540
RSA

1028
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,180
because

1029
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,380
he

1030
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:29,900
decrypts

1031
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,440
right

1032
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:30,960
and

1033
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,440
something

1034
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,840
that the

1035
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,100
client

1036
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,340
sent

1037
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:32,560
to him

1038
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:32,680
and

1039
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:32,820
can

1040
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,460
implicitly

1041
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:33,700
authenticate

1042
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,300
so

1043
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,620
that's

1044
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:34,900
gone

1045
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,540
instead

1046
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:36,720
of

1047
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:36,920
that

1048
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,140
they

1049
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,280
no

1050
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,480
longer

1051
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:37,740
say

1052
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:37,980
how

1053
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,100
you

1054
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,420
exchange

1055
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:38,540
the

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:38,680

1057
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:38,980
everything

1058
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,220
is

1059
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,380
done

1060
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,800
essentially

1061
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,040
by

1062
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,160
a

1065
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,160
or

1066
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,460
some

1067
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:42,960
version

1068
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,120
of

1069
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,360
DPA

1070
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,560
element

1071
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:43,820
which

1072
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,020
is

1073
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,500
either

1074
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:44,920
elliptic

1075
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,240
curve

1076
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,640
or

1077
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,480
normal

1078
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,240
and

1079
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,200
the

1080

1081
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,820
are now

1082
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,300
required

1083
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,520
so

1084
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:53,740
there's

1085
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:53,880
no

1086
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,080

1087
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,580

authentication

1089
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,560
so

1090
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:57,880
now

1091
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,280
both

1092
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,400
you

1093
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,600
know

1094
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,080
both

1095
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,520
clients

1096
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:00,660
and

1097
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:00,820
the

1098
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,100
server

1099
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,460
have

1100
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:01,620
to

1101
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:01,880
stop

1102
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,040
well

1103
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,240
the

1104
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,480
server

1105
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:02,680
has

1106
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:02,840
to

1107
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,100
stop

1108
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,500
basically

1109
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,480
and

1110
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:04,600
the

1111
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,920
client

1112
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,200
can

1113
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,600
sign

1114
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:05,860
with

1115
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,040
the

1116
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,760
ephemeral

1117
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,060
key

1118
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,180
they

1119
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,460
just

1120
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:08,840
generated

1121
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,940
okay

1122
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,140
so

1123
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,340
it's

1124
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:11,480
a

1125
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,080
strictly

1126
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,000
stronger

1127
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,420

1128
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:14,920
strictly

1129
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,320
more

1130
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,760
higher

1131
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,400

1132
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,380

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:17,660

1134
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:17,820

cost

1136
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,300
so

1137
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:19,640
that

1138
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:19,860

1140
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,900

00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,260

no

1146
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:23,880
it's

1147
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,100
just

1148
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,900

no

1154
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,480
it's

1155
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,620
a

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,180

1157
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,480

1159
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,260
and

1160
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,620
shading

1161
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:29,880
off

1162
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,040
some

1163
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,200

1164
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,380
the

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,480
questionable

1166
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,600
currently

1167
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,140
questionable

1168
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,800
algorithms

1169
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,680
allows us

1170
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:34,980
to do

1171
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,280
this

1172
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,460
because

1173
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:36,840
what the

1174
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,180
client

1175
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,120
can do

1176
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,520
now

1177
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:38,820
you see

1178
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,300
the client

1179
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,720
hello

1180
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,380
is still

1181
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,260
in the

1182
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,480
form

1183
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,380
the client

1184
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,740
says

1185
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,420
I don't know

1186
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:43,880
anything about

1187
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,360
this server

1188
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:44,640
right

1189
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,960
I just

1190
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,240
know the

1191
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,580
URL

1192
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,280
so what I want

1193
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,840
is I want a

1194
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,320
certificate

1195
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,160
that says

1196
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,020
that this

1197
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,080
URL is inside

1198
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,620
the certificate

1199
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,980
and it's signed

1200
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,420
by somebody

1201
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:55,980
I trust

1202
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,960
right

1203
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,580
so

1204
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,720
it's like

1205
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,380
essentially

1206
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,680
you come

1207
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:01,880
to

1208
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,620
I'm a

1209
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,180
I'm a

1210
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,440
hiring manager

1211
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,180
at a company

1212
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,920
you come to me

1213
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,380
and you say

1214
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,000
I have a UCI

1215
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,380
degree

1216
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,420
I may not have

1217
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,380
ever heard of UCI

1218
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,840
okay

1219
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,900
and I've never met

1220
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,180
you

1221
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,200
but if you give me

1222
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,940
a signed

1223
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,680
diploma

1224
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,020
signed by UCI

1225
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,520
register

1226
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,280
and then I look up

1227
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,120
UCI register

1228
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,200
and I see that

1229
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,160
they are certified

1230
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,960

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,960
Central Authority

1233
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,260
and that one

1234
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,820
is certified

1235
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,800
by a California

1236
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Department of Education

1237
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,740
well

1238
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,920
I trust

1239
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,800
the Department of Education

1240
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,560
of the state

1241
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,140
of California

1242
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,080
you see what I mean

1243
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,140
so I know

1244
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,020
their root certificate

1245
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,860
I will verify

1246
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,920
the UC certificate

1247
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,940
then I will verify

1248
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,880
UCI certificate

1249
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,220
then I will verify

1250
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,000
your certificate

1251
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,160
make sure it's valid

1252
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,360
make sure it's not revoked

1253
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,960
right

1254
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,760
that kind of thing

1255
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,820
so that's still the case

1256
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,760
the client

1257
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,020
before this starts

1258
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,860
does not trust

1259
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,280
the service

1260
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,140
just knows the URL

1261
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,280
and so

1262
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,240
that remains

1263
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,900
in both versions

1264
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,100
the web

1265
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,020
the fundamentals

1266
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,760
of the web

1267
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,360
don't change

1268
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,280
but what we're saying

1269
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,020
now is a client

1270
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,540
for example

1271
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,140
can generate

1272
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,500
like

1273
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,880
think of it

1274
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,140
as a temporary

1275
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,800
public key

1276
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,140
there

1277
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,480
right

1278
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,380
where he knows

1279
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,160
the private key

1280
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,440
and what he does

1281
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,100
is he can now

1282
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,660
send a message

1283
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,780
with a public key

1284
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,800
to the server

1285
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,860
and he can say

1286
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,600
and by the way

1287
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,120
I do know

1288
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,800
the private key

1289
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,360
and how can you do this

1290
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,020
he can sign

1291
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,060
with a private key

1292
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,960
that message

1293
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,460
that includes

1294
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,000
the public key

1295
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,480
kind of it was

1296
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,620
essentially like

1297
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,620
a self-signed certificate

1298
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,980
the server said

1299
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,980
oh look that's cool

1300
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,520
because now

1301
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,220
you're not joking

1302
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,480
you're not messing around

1303
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:31,720
with me

1304
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,280
you know the key

1305
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,860
which you

1306
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,380
you know the private key

1307
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,140
for which the public key

1308
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,040
you'll be just sending me

1309
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,200
so then the server says

1310
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
okay now I have

1311
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,720
my own certificate

1312
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,760
here's my certificate

1313
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,780
oh maybe a chain

1314
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,340
of certificates

1315
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,180
and I only use RSA

1316
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,820
certificates can be signed

1317
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,220
with RSA

1318
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,900
but my public key

1319
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,660
is no longer RSA

1320
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,160
it's some kind of

1321
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,900
D.K. Hellman type

1322
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,400
public key

1323
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,100
which can be used

1324
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,180
for many things

1325
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,420
but

1326
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,380
there it is

1327
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,380
so now

1328
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,580
a server has a public key

1329
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,360
from the form

1330
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,400
remember G to the B

1331
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,920
or something

1332
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,220
and the client

1333
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,160
has a public key

1334
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,680
remember G to the A

1335
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,300
and then they can

1336
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,960
each compute

1337
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,800
G to the A B

1338
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,160
okay

1339
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,840
so that's basically

1340
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,420
the idea

1341
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,180
and

1342
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,740
when the server

1343
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,500
receives that message

1344
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:18,840
one

1345
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,980
he's able to

1346
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,480
compute the key

1347
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,880
right away

1348
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,660
because

1349
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,560
he knows his

1350
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,020
you know

1351
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,920
he knows B

1352
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,340
right

1353
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,260
that's his private key

1354
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,620
and he receives

1355
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,320
G to the A

1356
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,420
so right away

1357
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,020
he knows it

1358
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,440
and in that second message

1359
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,540
the second green message

1360
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,680
he can already sign

1361
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,340
using that key

1362
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:34,860
or MAC

1363
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,160
okay

1364
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,040
so that message

1365
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,480
can be secure

1366
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,300
they already have

1367
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,680
a secret

1368
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,100
in common

1369
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,480
so

1370
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,340
what is

1371
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,700
yeah

1372
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,600
I would like to know

1373
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,760
for the client

1374
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,940
when the client

1375
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,820
decide to

1376
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,620
choose the

1377
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,720
TS 1.2

1378
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,600
and 1.2

1379
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,120
so

1380
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,460
so

1381
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,380
this is

1382
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,640
the client

1383
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,200
hello

1384
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,640
did you get

1385
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,240
that announcement

1386
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,720
I posted

1387
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,060
yes

1388
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,940
did you see

1389
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,440
that announcement

1390
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,080
I posted

1391
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,740
about this

1392
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,700
there's a very cute

1393
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,380
little site

1394
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,900
that if you expand

1395
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,420
everything

1396
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,140
it will tell you

1397
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,320
in excruciating

1398
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,240
detail

1399
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,480
everything

1400
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,080
you want to know

1401
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,500
about this

1402
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,080
now

1403
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,600
if you

1404
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,540
in that pointer

1405
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,420
that I sent you

1406
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,600
link

1407
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:25,900
right

1408
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,860
there's a 1.2

1409
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,460
if you substitute

1410
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,440
with 1.3

1411
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,020
you will see

1412
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,560
the same

1413
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,460
gory details

1414
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,660
of a 1.3

1415
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,100
handshake

1416
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,080
okay

1417
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,660
now

1418
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,540
the difference is

1419
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,080
the client

1420
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,380
hello

1421
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,960
is present

1422
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,680
in all of them

1423
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,700
so

1424
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,420
at the client

1425
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,100
hello stage

1426
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,160
the first thing

1427
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,780
that the server

1428
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,420
sees is

1429
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,540
the setup

1430
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,340
or the highest

1431
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,260
version

1432
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,180
that the client

1433
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,800
is supporting

1434
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,000
so if the client

1435
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,660
specifies

1436
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,440
the highest version

1437
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,020
he supports

1438
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,920
is 1.2

1439
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,360
that server

1440
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,600
says

1441
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,060
okay

1442
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,360
if I'm allowed

1443
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,760
for example

1444
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,140
the server

1445
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,420
could be

1446
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:01,980
federal government

1447
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,260
saying

1448
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,880
go away

1449
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,960
I don't

1450
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,160
I don't talk

1451
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,740
to anybody

1452
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,660
who doesn't

1453
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,380
speak the latest

1454
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:07,760
version

1455
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,580
okay

1456
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,920
but if it's

1457
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,400
an e-commerce

1458
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,840
site

1459
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,320
they're like

1460
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:11,840
I don't

1461
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,540
sell this one

1462
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,500
I don't care

1463
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,120
if you're using

1464
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,760
the latest version

1465
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,380
so it will say

1466
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:16,760
okay

1467
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,880
1.2 is fine

1468
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,480
you see what I mean

1469
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,540
if the client

1470
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:20,940
says

1471
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,580
oh

1472
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,260
1.3

1473
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,880
in the client

1474
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,740
the server

1475
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,340
could say

1476
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,640
yeah

1477
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,480
but I'm in

1478
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,280
I don't know

1479
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,960
Slabonia

1480
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,700
and we don't

1481
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,740
speak 1.3

1482
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,300
here yet

1483
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,340
we're still

1484
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:32,860
like living

1485
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,620
10 years ago

1486
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,200
so then

1487
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,980
we regress

1488
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,800
to 1.2

1489
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,120
you see what I mean

1490
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,660
so server will

1491
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,160
reply with

1492
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,840
1.2

1493
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,600
but yeah

1494
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,200
for the previous

1495
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,600
slide

1496
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,780
yeah

1497
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,880
for the previous

1498
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,080
slide

1499
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,780
it seems that

1500
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,340
the client

1501
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,940
sent more

1502
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,520
message

1503
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,000
if it

1504
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,380
uses

1505
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,320
1.3

1506
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,060
so if

1507
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,480
no

1508
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,760
no

1509
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,640
less

1510
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,060
less

1511
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,300
because

1512
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,680
look

1513
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,080
both of them

1514
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,280
say

1515
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,840
client

1516
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,080
hello

1517
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,420
right

1518
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,700
but the client

1519
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:58,980
hello

1520
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,680
is not exactly

1521
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,120
the same

1522
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,620
if you look

1523
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:00,840
at the

1524
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,360
that's why

1525
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,680
I told you

1526
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,080
if you look

1527
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,800
go into that

1528
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,240
website

1529
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,540
right

1530
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,800
and you compare

1531
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,360
the client

1532
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,720
hello

1533
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,440
messages

1534
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,020
for both

1535
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,580
1.2

1536
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:07,860
and 1.3

1537
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,140
they're not

1538
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,780
exactly the same

1539
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,740
but the beginning

1540
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,400
is the same

1541
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,000
do you see what I mean

1542
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,940
they are the same

1543
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,460
in the beginning

1544
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,220
so

1545
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,340
if you

1546
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,080
if the client

1547
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,460
hello

1548
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,880
is a 1.2

1549
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,260
hello

1550
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,500
the server

1551
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,400
will realize

1552
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:21,820
that

1553
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,580
you see what I mean

1554
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,720
so if the client

1555
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,960
is willing to speak

1556
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,580
1.3

1557
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,140
the client

1558
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,380
hello

1559
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,480
should be 1.3

1560
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,760
if the client

1561
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,060
hello

1562
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,160
the client speaks

1563
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
only 1.2

1564
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,240
up to 1.2

1565
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,640
he will

1566
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,040
it will be 1.2

1567
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,480
but the server

1568
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,020
will recognize

1569
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,360
by looking

1570
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,000
in the first byte

1571
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,600
yeah

1572
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:47,040
so

1573
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,080
no

1574
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,840
because

1575
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,700
the server

1576
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,180
will simply

1577
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,000
reply that

1578
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,800
my check

1579
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,380
cipher spec

1580
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,960
I will pick

1581
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,560
1.2

1582
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,040
now

1583
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,380
don't quote me

1584
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:56,700
on this

1585
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,020
but I think

1586
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
one is a superset

1587
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,500
of the other

1588
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,260
so it's still

1589
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,780
parsable

1590
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,360
you don't have

1591
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,860
to trust me

1592
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,460
you have to trust

1593
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,100
all these hundreds

1594
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,500
of people

1595
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:06,920
that work

1596
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,160
on this

1597
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,620
to make sure

1598
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,600
because it's all

1599
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,620
made for programmers

1600
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,020
right

1601
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,120
it was all

1602
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,960
made for people

1603
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,260
to make it easy

1604
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,940
to code

1605
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,920
to parse things

1606
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,740
right

1607
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,360
so even if

1608
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,600
the format

1609
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,060
changes

1610
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,960
the preamble

1611
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,800
almost never

1612
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,220
changes

1613
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,120
right

1614
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
so you should

1615
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,000
be looking

1616
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,380
at like

1617
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,080
the very

1618
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,320
first few

1619
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,020
fields

1620
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,820
in the header

1621
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,620
and say

1622
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,120
ah

1623
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,480
that will tell

1624
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,040
me the version

1625
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,460
right

1626
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,040
and if I don't

1627
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,940
support this version

1628
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,540
then I can't

1629
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,460
then it's an error

1630
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,460
but if I can't

1631
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,320
support this version

1632
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,080
then we can

1633
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,720
downgrade

1634
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,220
right

1635
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,860
if my policy

1636
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,600
allows me

1637
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,800
right

1638
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,840
so for example

1639
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,200
maybe

1640
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
that depends

1641
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,080
very much

1642
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,480
on web

1643
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:49,900
web

1644
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,240
web

1645
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,560
web

1646
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:50,860
web service

1647
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,400
policy

1648
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,940
whether it's

1649
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,620
like a client

1650
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,120
might come

1651
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,560
from

1652
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,800
within the

1653
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,040
US

1654
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,200
and say

1655
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,600
I speak

1656
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,240
1.2

1657
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,660
and the web

1658
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,280
server says

1659
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,740
okay

1660
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,960
I'll speak

1661
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,560
1.2

1662
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:01,920
with you

1663
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
and the client

1664
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,640
comes over

1665
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,600
from Botswana

1666
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,100
and the server

1667
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,380
says

1668
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:06,940
uh-uh

1669
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,660
I don't

1670
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,440
trust Botswana

1671
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,460
I don't know

1672
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,780
where the hell

1673
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,160
you are

1674
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,820
really

1675
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,020
so for foreign

1676
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,540
clients

1677
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:13,960
I will

1678
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,480
bunk with

1679
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,020
three or nothing

1680
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,680
it's totally

1681
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,040
fine

1682
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,980
to do that

1683
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,640
so primarily

1684
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,380
what do we

1685
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:22,740
use this

1686
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,080
to sell

1687
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,440
for

1688
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,820
I mean

1689
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,280
the primary

1690
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,640
thing

1691
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,280
has always

1692
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,660
been

1693
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,540
some kind

1694
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,180
of e-commerce

1695
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,080
right

1696
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,600
because

1697
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,260
we're buying

1698
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,620
stuff

1699
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,240
right

1700
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,760
internet

1701
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,500
was built

1702
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,060
essentially

1703
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,760
on e-commerce

1704
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,360
internet

1705
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,860
of today

1706
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,260
not

1707
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,000
the original

1708
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,300
internet

1709
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,260
I would say

1710
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:41,980
sorry

1711
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,800
correction

1712
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,480
the web

1713
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,020
right

1714
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,720
the driving force

1715
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,120
of the web

1716
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,820
is e-commerce

1717
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,620
so

1718
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,280
as I

1719
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,180
already motivated

1720
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,500
before

1721
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,340
client-less education

1722
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:53,760
is generally

1723
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,340
not needed

1724
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,440
why

1725
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,500
well because

1726
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,360
with what

1727
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,680
right

1728
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,380
you're going

1729
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,900
to an e-commerce

1730
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,340
site

1731
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,220
you're buying

1732
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,840
widgets

1733
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,620
from

1734
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,460
ADC

1735
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,080
incorporated

1736
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,960
and you may

1737
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,280
have never

1738
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,660
visited

1739
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,100
ADC

1740
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,600
incorporated

1741
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,240
you're

1742
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,960
bargain shopping

1743
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,240
right

1744
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,780
using google

1745
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,440
saying compare

1746
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:08,820
prices

1747
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,920
oh look at

1748
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,220
that

1749
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,060
a company

1750
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,740
in Kravistan

1751
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,580
all right

1752
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,600
cheap stuff

1753
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,120
let me get

1754
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,360
it

1755
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,820
they don't

1756
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,140
know you

1757
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,420
you don't

1758
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:16,880
know them

1759
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,000
okay

1760
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,520
so you

1761
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,000
authenticated

1762
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,280
them

1763
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,880
but why

1764
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,440
should you

1765
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,860
authenticate

1766
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,280
yourself

1767
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,840
as a client

1768
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,300
until you

1769
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:22,740
decide to

1770
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,000
buy

1771
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,360
and it's

1772
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,760
not really

1773
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,160
authentication

1774
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,700
that you're

1775
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:25,920
doing

1776
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,140
right

1777
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,540
you're just

1778
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:26,940
presenting

1779
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,360
a method

1780
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,840
of payment

1781
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,220
right

1782
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,120
which may be

1783
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,460
stolen

1784
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,180
as long as

1785
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:31,600
it's valid

1786
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,400
the web server

1787
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,020
doesn't care

1788
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,420
all they want

1789
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:34,900
to make sure

1790
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,800
is that you

1791
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,260
will pay

1792
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,540
who you are

1793
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,060
they don't really

1794
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,380
care

1795
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,100
so if you're

1796
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,080
sending credit

1797
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,880
card information

1798
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,560
over

1799
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,320
of course

1800
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,800
that should be

1801
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,220
protected

1802
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,820
so that's what

1803
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,100
really SSL is for

1804
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,400
now

1805
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,820
it's also there

1806
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,360
to protect

1807
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,860
to you

1808
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,000
against evil

1809
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,940
web servers

1810
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,980
and that's

1811
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,340
where it

1812
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:58,860
transcends

1813
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,320
e-commerce

1814
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,180
when you go

1815
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,380
to CNN.com

1816
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,440
assuming you

1817
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,000
trust CNN

1818
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,140
or whatever

1819
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,600
your taste

1820
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,020
may be

1821
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,000
fox.com

1822
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,800
you want

1823
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,280
to get news

1824
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,860
from them

1825
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,460
and not

1826
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,160
from some

1827
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,400
belorussian

1828
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,440
government agency

1829
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:13,960
right

1830
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,440
or a north

1831
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:15,800
korean

1832
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,740
mouthpiece

1833
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,180
of what's

1834
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,520
his name

1835
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,560
you know

1836
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,360
so you

1837
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:21,860
want to get

1838
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,600
the real

1839
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,060
thing

1840
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,340
so in that

1841
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,940
case it's

1842
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,460
not money

1843
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:25,880
that's a

1844
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,140
stake

1845
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,860
it's authenticity

1846
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,340
right

1847
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,880
in that case

1848
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,960
nobody cares

1849
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,620
that you

1850
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,380
actually encrypt

1851
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,580
right

1852
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,240
in that case

1853
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,640
you may not

1854
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,360
even care about

1855
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,040
encrypting the

1856
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,220
data

1857
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,880
you care about

1858
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,460
authenticating

1859
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:35,840
the server

1860
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,480
maybe using

1861
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,960
null encryption

1862
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,540
make sense

1863
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,620
right

1864
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,320
of course

1865
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,480
SSL

1866
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,000
and TLS

1867
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,580
they're not

1868
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,000
magic

1869
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,220
right

1870
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,540
they're not

1871
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:49,880
going to do

1872
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,240
anything

1873
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,080
about like

1874
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,840
guaranteeing

1875
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,440
that if you

1876
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,020
send credit

1877
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,600
card data

1878
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,480
and shipping

1879
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,120
address

1880
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,540
or whatever

1881
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,700
they're not

1882
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,320
going to sell

1883
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,480
it to some

1884
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,120
mass marketer

1885
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,980
or some

1886
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,400
annoying

1887
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,200
telemarketer

1888
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,180
or just

1889
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,600
give it to

1890
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,040
somebody on

1891
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,440
the street

1892
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:04,880
to quickly

1893
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,520
buy 500

1894
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,180
pair of jeans

1895
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,200
you know

1896
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,820
you have no

1897
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,360
idea what's

1898
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:08,660
happening

1899
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,940
with your

1900
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,340
credit card

1901
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,860
you're just

1902
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,080
going to

1903
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,560
trust them

1904
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:10,800
that they

1905
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,300
will erase

1906
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:11,480
it

1907
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:11,860
or store

1908
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,020
it

1909
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,460
securely

1910
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,760
most

1911
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,280
clients

1912
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,900
of course

1913
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,260
have no

1914
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:16,520
idea

1915
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:16,820
what it

1916
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,040
means

1917
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,360
for a

1918
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:17,560
server

1919
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,040
certificate

1920
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,400
to even

1921
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,780
exist

1922
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,060
right

1923
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,320
most

1924
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,240
think about

1925
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,540
not

1926
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,000
yourselves

1927
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,380
because

1928
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:21,720
you're all

1929
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,160
super

1930
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,480
educated

1931
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:22,940
folks

1932
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,180
but

1933
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,560
think

1934
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:23,820
about

1935
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,240
various

1936
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,580
family

1937
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,020
members

1938
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,340
and

1939
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:25,640
you know

1940
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:25,960
some of

1941
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,080
them

1942
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,280
are

1943
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,960
children

1944
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,800
they don't

1945
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,000
know

1946
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,400
they use

1947
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,780
the web

1948
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,120
they use

1949
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,560
the internet

1950
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:29,980
they have

1951
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,420
no idea

1952
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:30,760
what it

1953
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,200
all means

1954
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,720
so we

1955
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,380
rely on

1956
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,740
conscious

1957
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,520
correct

1958
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,560
implementations

1959
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,280
to make

1960
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,720
sure

1961
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,280
that

1962
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,780
certificates

1963
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,380
are valid

1964
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,080
the certificates

1965
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,900
correspond to

1966
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,480
the websites

1967
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,060
that they're

1968
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,800
assigned to

1969
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,120
etc

1970
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,340
more importantly

1971
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:49,940
than

1972
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,020
e-commerce

1973
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,700
although that's

1974
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,340
not as much

1975
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:53,900
of a segment

1976
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,260
for

1977
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:54,980
application

1978
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,680
domain

1979
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:55,980
for

1980
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,940
CLS

1981
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,320
is

1982
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:57,740
banking

1983
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,140
and other

1984
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,640
financial

1985
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,240
services

1986
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,580
right

1987
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,760
it's kind

1988
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:00,860
of

1989
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,540
you can

1990
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:01,800
think of

1991
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,020
it as

1992
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,380
hyper

1993
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:02,840
e-commerce

1994
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,180
right

1995
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,520
this is

1996
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:03,840
where the

1997
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,080
money

1998
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,600
the real

1999
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:04,860
money

2000
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,000
is

2001
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,240
your

2002
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,580
money

2003
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,840
right

2004
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,580
here the

2005
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:07,940
bank is

2006
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,440
not selling

2007
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:08,960
you anything

2008
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,240
right

2009
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,720
you already

2010
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,420
decided to

2011
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:10,740
put your

2012
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,080
money in

2013
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,380
the bank

2014
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:11,600
and you

2015
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:11,900
have a

2016
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,420
relationship

2017
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,500
so instead

2018
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:13,960
of entering

2019
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,660
your credit

2020
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,080
card info

2021
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,800
actually here

2022
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,460
you do

2023
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,040
enter

2024
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,460
to begin

2025
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:18,900
a session

2026
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,180
with the

2027
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:19,380
bank

2028
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:19,780
you do

2029
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,220
enter

2030
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,600
your

2031
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,060
username

2032
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,680
password

2033
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,220
and god

2034
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,560
knows what

2035
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:22,840
else

2036
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,940
MFA

2037
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,360
right

2038
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,140
so

2039
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,880
there's

2040
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,120
more

2041
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,480
of a

2042
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:27,920
beginning

2043
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,180
of a

2044
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,420
session

2045
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:28,720
and end

2046
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,280
but notice

2047
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,700
that people

2048
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,060
go to

2049
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,400
banks

2050
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,960
also to

2051
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,340
browse

2052
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,640
let's

2053
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:31,840
say

2054
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,860
interest

2055
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,260
rates

2056
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,880
without

2057
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,340
having to

2058
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,700
log in

2059
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,900
so you

2060
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,320
do want

2061
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,580
to make

2062
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:36,960
sure you're

2063
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,260
going to

2064
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,680
the bank

2065
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,820
it's the

2066
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,340
right bank

2067
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,980
and it

2068
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,540
displays you

2069
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,040
truthful

2070
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,680
information

2071
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,600
so SSL

2072
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,120
TLS is

2073
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,660
useful there

2074
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,000
too

2075
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,680
right

2076
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,260
even without

2077
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,740
you logging

2078
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,100
in

2079
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,160
and authenticating

2080
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,600
yourself

2081
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,480
sometimes

2082
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,460
in early

2083
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,200
2000s

2084
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,220
mid 2000s

2085
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,420
some banks

2086
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,020
that were

2087
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,320
kind of

2088
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,560
hip

2089
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:54,740
and

2090
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,060
cool

2091
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,440
thought

2092
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:55,720
they

2093
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,740
would

2094
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,040
send

2095
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,900
customers

2096
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,720
I think

2097
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,020
I mentioned

2098
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,260
before

2099
00:31:59,260 --> 00:31:59,800
like various

2100
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,280
dongles

2101
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:00,780
and USB

2102
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,140
keys

2103
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,440
and other

2104
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:01,760
things

2105
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,500
that you

2106
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,060
could use

2107
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,440
to upload

2108
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:04,960
a client

2109
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,540
certificate

2110
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,840
for SSL

2111
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,240
TLS

2112
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,360
that way

2113
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,640
you could

2114
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:08,940
have

2115
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,680
strong

2116
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,120
two-way

2117
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,720
authentication

2118
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,300
this

2119
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,660
somehow

2120
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,100
fell out

2121
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,220
of

2122
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,640
fashion

2123
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,860
okay

2124
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,580
that's

2125
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,500
the end

2126
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:18,700
of

2127
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,440
SSL

2128
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,940
TLS

2129
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,220
now we

2130
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,680
go on

2131
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,140
to

2132
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,100
another

2133
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,700
beautiful

2134
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,480
masterpiece

2135
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,060
IPsec

2136
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:41,840
quick show

2137
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,220
of hands

2138
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,060
how many

2139
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,600
people here

2140
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,260
have heard

2141
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,980
IPsec

2142
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,180
two

2143
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,480
three

2144
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:46,620
and

2145
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:46,800
well

2146
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,280
okay

2147
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,120
so

2148
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,700
IPsec

2149
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,320
is IP

2150
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,000
security

2151
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,520

speaking

2154
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,040
unlike

2155
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,020
Carverus

2156
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,400
which is

2157
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,220
a system

2158
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,660
right

2159
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,540
Carverus

2160
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:00,800
remember

2161
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,560
e-system

2162
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,520
have

2163
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:02,760
many

2164
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,380
protocols

2165
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:03,800
right

2166
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,180
components

2167
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,080
SSL

2168
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,580
TLS

2169
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,460
is a

2170
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,340
protocol

2171
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,840
right

2172
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,160
our

2173
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,920
protocol suite

2174
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,260
really

2175
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,480
and a set

2176
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:16,980
of formats

2177
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,220
right

2178
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,600
the protocols

2179
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
always have

2180
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,040
formats

2181
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,600
for messages

2182
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,000
so

2183
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,740
IPsec

2184
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,720
strictly speaking

2185
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,580
is not

2186
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:23,980
a protocol

2187
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,200
it is

2188
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,840
actually

2189
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,740
a set

2190
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,340
of formats

2191
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,480
okay

2192
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:30,780
so

2193
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,100
this will

2194
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,340
become

2195
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,720
clear

2196
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,420
maybe a

2197
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,700
little bit

2198
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,100
puzzling

2199
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,320
at the

2200
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,580
moment

2201
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,220
become

2202
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,660
clear

2203
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,320
in a

2204
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,560
bit

2205
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,220
I hope

2206
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,360
so

2207
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,900
let's

2208
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,260
consider

2209
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,720
IP

2210
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,700
IP

2211
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,680
is the

2212
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,760
lingua franca

2213
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,140
the English

2214
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,880
of the internet

2215
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,240
right

2216
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,540
you want

2217
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:47,640
to

2218
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,680
communicate

2219
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,280
you kind of

2220
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,700
better speak

2221
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:50,980
English

2222
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,480
in the business

2223
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,060
world today

2224
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,360
well

2225
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,060
if you want

2226
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,500
to communicate

2227
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:53,920
today

2228
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,440
you need

2229
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:54,840
to speak

2230
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,180
IP

2231
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,660
you don't

2232
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:55,900
speak

2233
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,220
IP

2234
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,040
you are

2235
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,440
basically

2236
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,020
all right

2237
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,420
IP

2238
00:33:59,420 --> 00:33:59,780
is the

2239
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,100

2240
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,540
layer

2241
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:00,940
it is

2242
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,340
what's

2243
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,500
called

2244
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:01,700
the

00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,100
thin

2246
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,780
waste

2247
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,580
because

2248
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,080
the internet

2249
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,660
has this

2250
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:04,980
kind of

2251
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,640
a

2252
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,760
what do you

2253
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,100
call it

2254
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,660
the hourglass

2255
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,480
the hourglass

2256
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:13,860
shape

2257
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,400
if you look

2258
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,620
at the

2259
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,020
protocols

2260
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,620
right

2261
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,440
there are

2262
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,600
many

2263
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,120
protocols

2264
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,440
why do I

2265
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,180
say hourglass

2266
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,720
right

2267
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,360
so

2268
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:28,080
so

2269
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,280
this

2270
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,420
will

2271
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:28,540
be

2272
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:28,960
physical

2273
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,420

2274
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,760

2275
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,100
link

2276
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,800
and

2277
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,060
here

2278
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,320
is

2279
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:33,740
network

2280
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,100

2281
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,960
here

2282
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,100
is

2283
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,300
where

2284
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:35,680
IP

2285
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,260
goes

2286
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,020
so

2287
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,400
here

2288
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,060
things

2289
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,260
get

2290
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:38,660
thicker

2291
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,220

00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:39,620
IP

2293
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,080
let's

2294
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,240
say

2295
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,480
this

2296
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:40,620
is

2297
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:40,880

2298
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,280
and

2299
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,580
above

2300
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:42,840
IP

2301
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,060
you

2302
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,360
have

2303
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,560
transport

2304
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,280

2307
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,100
so

2308
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,440
I have a

2309
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,020

2311
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,180
whatever

2312
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,640
I forget

2313
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:50,880
that

2314
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,360
but

2315
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,600
they're

2316
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:51,780
all

2317
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,580

2318
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,500

2319
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,020
here

2320
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,360
you have

2321
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,740
lots of

2328
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,820

2331
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,240

2332
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,760

2333
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,380

layer

2341
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,880
you have

2342
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,200
Wi-Fi

2343
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,620

2348
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,320
you have

2349
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,000
right

2350
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,360
all these

00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,020
oh

all these

2363
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,740

2365
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,580
so

2366
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:30,760
there are

2367
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,340

many choices

2370
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,620

2371
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,260
as the

nothing

2381
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,720
that's

2382
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:39,960
what it's

2453
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,760
I'm not

2454
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,120
that old

2455
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,540
but

2456
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,360
it was

2457
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,560
done

2458
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:20,760
a lot

2459
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:20,940
of it

2460
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,220
was done

2461
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,420
there

2462
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:21,980
at UCLA

2463
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,560
also

2464
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,480
there were

2465
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:24,700
some

2466
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,580
internet

2467
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,160
pioneers

2468
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,660
who designed

2469
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:26,980
some of

2470
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,180
this

2471
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,340
and

2472
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:27,860
DARPA

2473
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,580
which is a

2474
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:28,880
defense

2475
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,260
advanced

2476
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:29,620
research

2477
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,000
project

2478
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,520
agency

2479
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,380
funded

2480
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:32,900
all of

2481
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,180
this

2482
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:33,540
and

2483
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:33,820
without

2484
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,100
DARPA

2485
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,300
there

2486
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:34,380
would

2487
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,460
have

2488
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:34,580
been

2489
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:34,780
no

00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,140
internet

2491
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,560
anyway

2492
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:37,960
so

2493
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,240
it was

2494
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,700
designed

2495
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,800
to connect

2496
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,760
a bunch

2497
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,060
of

2498
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,820

2499
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,160

2501
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,000
and

2502
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,180
all

2503
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,500
people

2504
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:43,820
well

2505
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,080
to

2507
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,420
and

2508
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:45,800
primary

2509
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,660
motivation

2510
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,040
back

2511
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,280
then

2512
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,440
for

2513
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,620

internet

2515
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,440
was

2516
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:48,660
to

2517
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,220

2518
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,280

2520
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,280
remember

2521
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,040
back

2522
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,400
then

2523
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,260
you had

2524
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,820
computers

2525
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,420
most

2526
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:57,600

00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:57,720
them

2528
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:57,880
there

2529
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:57,980
were

00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,160

zero

2537
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,420

00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:01,740
FB

2539
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:01,900
was

2540
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,160
designed

such

2544
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:03,860
a

2545
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:03,980
thing

2546
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,120
did

2547
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,300
not

00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,620

2549
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,460
they

2550
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:05,660
were

2551
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,780
mid-range

2552
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,320

2553
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,120
and they

2554
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,280
were

2555
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,580
like

2556
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,360
mainframes

2557
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,020

2559
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,240
and then

2560
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,720
the few

2561
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,200
here and

2562
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,460
there

2563
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:13,740
around

2564
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:13,880

supercomputers

2567
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,920
okay

2568
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,140
a

2570
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:16,960

00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,500
back

2573
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:17,720
then

2574
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:17,880
is

2575
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,020
an

2578
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:18,980
today

2579
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,040
in

2581
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,300

power

2585
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,480
but

2586
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:22,640
they

2587
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:22,860

00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:23,680
and

2590
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:23,800
it

2591
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,000
took

2592
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,280
like

2593
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,480
a

2598
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,500

computer

2600
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,560
because

2601
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,820
these

2602
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,220
resources

2603
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,480
were

2604
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,880
scarce

2605
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,120

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,400
expensive

2609
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,680
like

2610
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,140
gazillions

2611
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,340

dollars

2613
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,480
they

2614
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:35,920
were

2615
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,400
precious

2616
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,740
right

2617
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,120
and people

2618
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,460
who wanted

2619
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:37,940
to perform

2620
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,760
large scale

2621
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,460
computation

2622
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,920
of any

00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,260
kind

2624
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,980
have to

2625
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,260
like

2626
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,880
buy

2627
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,400
time

2628
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,100
on those

2629
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,420
computers

2630
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,600
and

2631
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:46,760
if

2632
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:46,920
you

2633
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,660
do

2634
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:47,820
it

2635
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:47,940
you

2636
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,480
travel

2637
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:48,900
somewhere

2638
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,100
to

2639
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,280
use

2640
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,400
your

2641
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,800
computer

2642
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,660
right

2643
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:50,860
there

2644
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,320
physically

2645
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,800
but

2646
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,560
that's

2647
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:52,700
not

2648
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,060
scalable

2649
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,980
so

2650
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,220
people

2651
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,640
realize

2652
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:54,820
that

2653
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:54,940
if

2654
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,020
you

2655
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,160
want

2656
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,280
to

2657
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,400
have

2658
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:55,740
access

2659
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,160

2660
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,560
access

2661
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:56,860
to

2662
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,840
resources

2663
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,220
like

2664
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:58,580
that

2665
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,020
you

2666
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,240
need

2667
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,380
to

2668
00:37:59,380 --> 00:37:59,700
connect

2669
00:37:59,700 --> 00:37:59,900
them

2670
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,240
somehow

2671
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,460
and

2672
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:00,780
dial

2673
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,020
up

2674
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,220
what

2675
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:01,760
existed

2676
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,900
modems

2677
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,280
remember

2678
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,680
modems

2679
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:03,940
maybe

2680
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,140
you've

2681
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,300
seen

2682
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,500
old

2683
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:04,780
movies

2684
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,000
go

2685
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,360
and

2686
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,020
there's

2687
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,100
a

2688
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,340
modem

2689
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,740
connection

2690
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,340
yeah

2691
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,480
it's

2692
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:08,600
not

2693
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:08,880
somebody

2694
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,100
having

2695
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,280
a

2696
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,540
cold

2697
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,720
well

2698
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:10,940
I

2699
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,180
still

2700
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,440
remember

2701
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:11,760
that

2702
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,620
and

2703
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,100
but

2704
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,260
that

2705
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,460
was

2706
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,000
totally

2707
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,380
terrible

2708
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:14,900
because

2709
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,080
you

2710
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,200
were

2711
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,580
using

2712
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,640
unstable

2713
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,080
telephone

2714
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,540
lines

2715
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:17,780
and

2716
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,200
terrible

2717
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,600
equipment

2718
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,780
so

2719
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,400
there was

2720
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:20,620
the idea

2721
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,060
to connect

2722
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,420
them all

2723
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:21,700
with

2724
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,140
dedicated

2725
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,780
lines

2726
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,300
okay

2727
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:24,720
so

2728
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,540
there you

2729
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:26,960
have the birth

2730
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,460
of the internet

2731
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:27,880
right

2732
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,520
and they

2733
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:28,920
needed a

2734
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,240
protocol

2735
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,140
that would

2736
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,580
basically

2737
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,060
break

2738
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,800
communication

2739
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,560
data

2740
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,140
arbitrary

2741
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,620
size

2742
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,160
into

2743
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,800
small

2744
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,240
uniform

2745
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,680
size

2746
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,100
chunks

2747
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,880
and

2748
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,260
transmit

2749
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,480
them

2750
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,720
hop

2751
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,100
by hop

2752
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,520
by hop

2753
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,020
by hop

2754
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,660
to their

2755
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,260
destination

2756
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,080
why

2757
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:41,680
hop

2758
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:41,940
because

2759
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,120
you

2760
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,380
couldn't

2761
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:42,840
have

2762
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,620
fully

2763
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,060
connected

2764
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,500
network

2765
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:44,860
right

2766
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,120
everybody

2767
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,600
connected

2768
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:46,780
to

2769
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,200
everything

2770
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,060
that would

2771
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,600
be incredibly

2772
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,120
expensive

2773
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,800
logistically

2774
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,400
nightmare

2775
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,560
right

2776
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:51,740
so

2777
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:51,980
they

2778
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,180
needed

2779
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,320
to

2780
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,600
connect

2781
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:52,720
them

2782
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:52,920
via

2783
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,580
switches

2784
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,240
routers

2785
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,400
right

2786
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,500
that scales

2787
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,520
so

2788
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,040
the internet

2789
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,740
protocol

2790
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,260
was designed

2791
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,580
for that

2792
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,040
to hop

2793
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,440
along

2794
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:02,820
these

2795
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,340
routers

2796
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,740
and switches

2797
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,140
until

2798
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,420
these

2799
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:04,760
get to

2800
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:04,900
the

2801
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,440
destination

2802
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,000
IP

2803
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,340
protocol

2804
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,620
does

2805
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:06,980
not

2806
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,820
actually

2807
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,320
perform

2808
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:08,820
the routing

2809
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,240
function

2810
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,820
it doesn't

2811
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,200
distribute

2812
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,680
routes

2813
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,800
okay

2814
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,400
that's done

2815
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,700
by what's

2816
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:12,840
called

2817
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,220
routing

2818
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:13,680
protocols

2819
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,260
which you

2820
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:14,500
should have

2821
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:14,860
learned in

2822
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,240
your networking

2823
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,620
course

2824
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,040
IP just

2825
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,640
forwards

2826
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,020
things

2827
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,100
all it

2828
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,440
knows

2829
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,020
is how

2830
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,220
to

2831
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,860
let the

2832
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,160
source

2833
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,820
generate

2834
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,240
the packet

2835
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,400
stick it

2836
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:24,600
on the

2837
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:24,880
wire

2838
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,540
give it

2839
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:25,780
to the

2840
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,200
data link

2841
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,380
layer

2842
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:26,760
below

2843
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,280
and then

2844
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,220
at the

2845
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:29,820
next hop

2846
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,720
whatever that

2847
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,340
hop might be

2848
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:31,760
it might be

2849
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,340
the destination

2850
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,120
or it might

2851
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,960
be a router

2852
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,220
pick that packet

2853
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,640
up saying

2854
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,000
hmm

2855
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,720
let's see

2856
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,040
destination

2857
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,480
I don't

2858
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:39,780
know this

2859
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,220
destination

2860
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,940
I am not

2861
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,580
that destination

2862
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,480
but I think

2863
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,160
somebody else

2864
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,580
I know

2865
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,280
knows where

2866
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,780
the destination

2867
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,020
is

2868
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,840
so you forward

2869
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,400
it to somebody

2870
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:46,940
else who knows

2871
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,280
better

2872
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,320
according to

2873
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,980
some routing

2874
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,280
data

2875
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,220
so back then

2876
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,580
the internet

2877
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,140
was small

2878
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,360
and very friendly

2879
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,660
it was populated

2880
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,580
by idealistic

2881
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,060
and naive

2882
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,460
geeks

2883
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,180
who just wanted

2884
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,640
to compute

2885
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,100
stuff

2886
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,200
right

2887
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,820
and they were

2888
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,560
not you know

2889
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,020
hostile

2890
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,720
I mean they were

2891
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,200
they could be

2892
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,440
hostile

2893
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:06,880
but they were

2894
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,980
not about

2895
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,460
to attack

2896
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:08,920
the internet

2897
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,880
the cow

2898
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,300
that feeds

2899
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:10,740
them all

2900
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,400
right

2901
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,640
it was all

2902
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,140
essentially

2903
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,100
research

2904
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,240
and almost

2905
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,800
no commercial

2906
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,540
use was allowed

2907
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,260
on the internet

2908
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,380
until early 90s

2909
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,760
so for good

2910
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,300
like 12

2911
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,120
14 years

2912
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,660
there was no

2913
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,080
such thing

2914
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,520
as commerce

2915
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,040
on the internet

2916
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,720
and so

2917
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,580
from that

2918
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,420
small and

2919
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,120
friendly world

2920
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,720
we wound up

2921
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,240
what we have

2922
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,620
today

2923
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,780
essentially

2924
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,440
internet

2925
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,540
in many ways

2926
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,660
is a giant

2927
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,320
global sewer

2928
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,120
where everything

2929
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,480
goes

2930
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:39,940
and anything

2931
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,400
flies

2932
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,840
and back then

2933
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,460
all the hosts

2934
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,120
were known

2935
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,580
in fact

2936
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,100
if you were

2937
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,460
running a

2938
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,040
unix machine

2939
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,580
back then

2940
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,560
you didn't even

2941
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,380
need domain name

2942
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:48,700
service

2943
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,380
you could have

2944
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,060
what's a file

2945
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,360
called

2946
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,520
etc password

2947
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,340
there was a file

2948
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,200
called etc hosts

2949
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,840
and it actually

2950
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,200
listed one per line

2951
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,220
names

2952
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,620
and IP addresses

2953
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
of every host

2954
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,080
on the internet

2955
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,800
yeah

2956
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,200
I remember

2957
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,840
when I inherited

2958
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,300
my first

2959
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,520
machine

2960
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,420
in grad school

2961
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,440
it was like

2962
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,700
from

2963
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,320
the machine

2964
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,500
was older

2965
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,440
but it had

2966
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:11,980
this file

2967
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,200
and it had

2968
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,840
like I don't know

2969
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,340
5,000 entries

2970
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,260
and there were

2971
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,740
all the hosts

2972
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,220
on the internet

2973
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,880
that's it

2974
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,100
everywhere in the world

2975
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,160
the users

2976
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,260
were limited too

2977
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:23,680
right

2978
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,640
security was

2979
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,140
essentially

2980
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,860
not an issue

2981
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,360
back then

2982
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,260
in that world

2983
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,980
it was not an issue

2984
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,080
think of it

2985
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,540
as the internet

2986
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,560
was essentially

2987
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,800
like a hippie

2988
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,100
hippie-dippie

2989
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,580
private network

2990
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,160
you couldn't

2991
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,720
just like

2992
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,820
randomly hook up

2993
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,420
to the internet

2994
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,460
there was no

2995
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:40,920
wireless

2996
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,960
access

2997
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,780
zero

2998
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,080
okay

2999
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,840
the easiest way

3000
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,340
to work with

3001
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:46,640
the internet

3002
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,480
was to actually

3003
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:47,860
like

3004
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,340
use a

3005
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:50,860
wired

3006
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,480
ethernet

3007
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:51,900
right

3008
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,280
you have an

3009
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,900
ethernet port

3010
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,400
in the wall

3011
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,740
you

3012
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,600
start with

3013
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:55,920
wire

3014
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,240
and

3015
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,020
if you have

3016
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,700
internet access

3017
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,280
you can start

3018
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,480
doing

3019
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,820
well

3020
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,620
as you know

3021
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,120
the world has

3022
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,760
changed dramatically

3023
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,480
since then

3024
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,520
so

3025
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,680
security has

3026
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,360
become an issue

3027
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,820
now

3028
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,600
people were not

3029
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,460
totally naive

3030
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:09,800
already

3031
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,780
in the late 80s

3032
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,460
they started

3033
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,000
thinking about

3034
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,700
what will happen

3035
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,200
when the internet

3036
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,380
becomes available

3037
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,060
to the masses

3038
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,100
and becomes

3039
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,800
commercialized

3040
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,540
so

3041
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,520
hostility

3042
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:19,900
or

3043
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,780
essentially

3044
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,980
lack of security

3045
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,860
in the original

3046
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,180
internet

3047
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,680
was already

3048
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,580
a problem

3049
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,620
so what can

3050
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:25,980
you do with

3051
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,260
IP

3052
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:26,740
IP

3053
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,740
even if you

3054
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,000
don't know

3055
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,220
anything

3056
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,660
about it

3057
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:28,860
just

3058
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,900
trust me

3059
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,440
you will

3060
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:30,840
see the

3061
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,120
format

3062
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,300
in a minute

3063
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,840
allows very

3064
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,540
easy address

3065
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,020
spoofing

3066
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,820
so

3067
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,220
IP packets

3068
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,560
all have

3069
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:40,880
a header

3070
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,640
and a header

3071
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,060
says

3072
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,380
among other things

3073
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,040
where is this

3074
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,760
packet coming from

3075
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,180
and where is it

3076
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:45,600
going to

3077
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,580
otherwise it would

3078
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,240
make no sense

3079
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,640
at least the

3080
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,040
destination

3081
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,280
but the source

3082
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,580
is the spoofed

3083
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,700
the source is just

3084
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,440
an IP address

3085
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,340
IP address

3086
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:55,940
is not in the

3087
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,620
form of authentication

3088
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,600
it's just

3089
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,380
there

3090
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,100
right

3091
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,000
you can just

3092
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,340
like

3093
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,720
substitute it

3094
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,120
with some

3095
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,860
other IP address

3096
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,360
and so if you

3097
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,060
do some kind

3098
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:07,560
of filtering

3099
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,260
based on

3100
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,400
source IP

3101
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:09,820
addresses

3102
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,060
you're fooling

3103
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,360
yourself

3104
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:11,880
because it

3105
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,260
doesn't mean

3106
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:12,600
anything

3107
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,980
the source address

3108
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,700
why do we

3109
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,220
use the source

3110
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,400
address

3111
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:17,900
well because

3112
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,580
the destination

3113
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,080
when it wants

3114
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,520
to reply

3115
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:19,920
it needs to

3116
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,340
know where to

3117
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:20,620
reply

3118
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,200
so we still

3119
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,580
need the

3120
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:21,740
source

3121
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,060
in the

3122
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,240
kitchen

3123
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,960
most packets

3124
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,940
anybody can

3125
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,540
take a packet

3126
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,660
not touch

3127
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,780
the source

3128
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,120
address

3129
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,700
but modify

3130
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,360
the destination

3131
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:32,760
address

3132
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,620
or modify

3133
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,080
the payload

3134
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,480
right

3135
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:35,900
the data

3136
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,140
just pick

3137
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:37,740
something up

3138
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,740
yeah

3139
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,140
sure

3140
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,220
packets can

3141
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,020
be reordered

3142
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,240
right

3143
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,580
so if a

3144
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,680
malicious router

3145
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,700
receives packets

3146
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,460
and you can

3147
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:51,900
say oh I

3148
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,440
received packet

3149
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,680
one before

3150
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,300
I received packet

3151
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,100
two but I'm

3152
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,520
going to send

3153
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:56,880
out packet

3154
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,380
two first and

3155
00:43:59,380 --> 00:43:59,780
then packet

3156
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,500
one just to

3157
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,140
confuse and

3158
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,700
annoy people

3159
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,160
but maybe

3160
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,820
actually there's

3161
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,260
a security

3162
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:05,760
application

3163
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,920
if you send

3164
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,040
them the good

3165
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,780
example I tell

3166
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,340
kids in the

3167
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,160
undergrad class

3168
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,800
why reordering is

3169
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,620
important is think

3170
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,100
about this

3171
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,860
this is actually

3172
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,360
used to be the

3173
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:15,960
case back in

3174
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,040
the early 80s

3175
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,000
the ATM machines

3176
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,820
which used to

3177
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,720
have bank

3178
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,340
ATM machines

3179
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:20,880
used to have

3180
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,360
their own

3181
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,340
private network

3182
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,920
and if you

3183
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,240
and all these

3184
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,040
transactions that

3185
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,480
you do at the

3186
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,040
ATM like

3187
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,120
withdraw $100

3188
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,360
deposit $500

3189
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,480
check my balance

3190
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,280
they were like

3191
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:33,900
messages

3192
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,400
okay

3193
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,400
and so

3194
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,840
if you were at

3195
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,560
ATM and you

3196
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,300
said okay well

3197
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,320
here's a $500

3198
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:40,980
deposit

3199
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,400
and transaction

3200
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,560
click return

3201
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,440
and here's a $200

3202
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,400
withdrawal

3203
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,620
on cash

3204
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,700
well that's fine

3205
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,320
but what if you

3206
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,140
reverse the two

3207
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,700
if you reverse the

3208
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:54,920
two

3209
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,040
you're going to

3210
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,900
get hit with

3211
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,740
overdraft charges

3212
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,960
right

3213
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,220
if you reorder

3214
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:01,660
these two

3215
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,460
so that's why

3216
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,240
ordering actually

3217
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,020
matters a lot

3218
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,180
I mean not just

3219
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:06,740
that's a silly

3220
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,200
example

3221
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,860
of course it

3222
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,200
doesn't work

3223
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:08,720
today but

3224
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,140
it's an issue

3225
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,380
and it actually

3226
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,020
happens even

3227
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,140
today if you

3228
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,360
use ATM for

3229
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,560
example in a

3230
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,140
foreign country

3231
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,700
sometimes they're

3232
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,860
poorly connected

3233
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,040
and you may

3234
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,720
still like for

3235
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,120
example you

3236
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:22,540
deposit

3237
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,060
something in

3238
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:26,660
one ATM

3239
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,760
and the

3240
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,760
deposit takes

3241
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,960
a day but

3242
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,520
in the meantime

3243
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,360
you withdrew

3244
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,020
something in a

3245
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,600
different ATM

3246
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,440
that is well

3247
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,780
connected and

3248
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,120
it happens

3249
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,500
immediately

3250
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,420
you may have

3251
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:38,760
a problem

3252
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,140
anyway reordering

3253
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,760
is an issue

3254
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,580
deletion is an

3255
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:42,960
issue but

3256
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,300
there's nothing

3257
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:43,620
we can do

3258
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,140
about deletion

3259
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,480
right so

3260
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,200
we can delete

3261
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:45,860
packets right

3262
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,160
discard them

3263
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:47,860
on the way

3264
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,300
eavesdropping

3265
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,060
replay

3266
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,320
replaying

3267
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:54,940
recording

3268
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,700
all packets

3269
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,700
or recording

3270

in real time

3272
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,460
and then

3273
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,260
replaying them

3274
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,700
later

3275
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,900

3276
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,760

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,520
just data

3278
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,040
right

3279
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,420

00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,500
you to

00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:08,840
understand

3282
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,240
because it's

3283
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:09,500
important

3284
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,920
for IPsec

3285
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,600

00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:13,880
carried in

00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,200
the packet

00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,380
you can

protect

3294
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,120

3335
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,220
it leaks

00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,100
this packet

3340
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,700
coming from

00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,620
and where

3342
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,000
is it going

3343
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,280
to

3344
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,560
that itself

in many cases

3348
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,840
think about

00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,380

3350
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,180
now you ever

3351
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:57,820
heard of countries

3352
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,140
that do

3353
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:58,540
censorship

3354
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,860
right

3355
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,660
based on

3356
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,200
where packets

3357
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,680
come from

3358
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,200
going to

3359
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,620
a number

3360
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,020
of countries

3361
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,460
do that

3362
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,900
that comes

3363
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,420
from metadata

3364
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,260
so

3365
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,620
IPsec

3366
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,240
is a

3367
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,120

3368
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,720
thin layer

3371
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,840
right

3372
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,140
so it

3373
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:17,480
doesn't

3374
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:17,960

3375
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,340

3389
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,080
for example

3390
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,380
uses

3391
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:26,940
there's a number

00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:27,740

for Wi-Fi

3395
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,500
if you dig

3396
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,280

3399
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,200
you'll see

3400
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:32,480
there's

3401
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:32,960

3405
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,900

3406
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,160
most of you

3407
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:37,440
have

3408
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,500
whole routers

3409
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:38,800

3412
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,120

3413
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,480
set up

3414
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:40,820

3415
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,340
you've seen

3416
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,260
the choices

3417
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,360
different choices

3423
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,880

00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,800
last hop

3425
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,060

3429
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,200

3436
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,040
not going

3437
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,360

00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:58,700

long run

3444
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,240
and so

3445
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,460
you can

3446
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:02,840
do this

00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,160

3453
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,280

n-to-n

3457
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,280
and so

3458
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:08,560
IP

3459
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,860
is the

3468
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,000
so we

3469
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,400

3475
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:21,340
not a

3476
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:21,940
transport layer

3477
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,240
it's just

3478
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:22,540
like a

3479
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:22,980
sublayer

3480
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,280
on top

3481
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,680
of network

3482
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:23,920
layer

3483
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,580
and its

3484
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,000
presence

3485
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,300
is

3486
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:26,940
transparent

3487
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,220
okay

3488
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:28,740
TCP

3489
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,660
UDP

3490
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,860
they don't

3491
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:31,100
know

3492
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:31,420
that it

3493
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:31,940
exists

3494
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,520
just a

3495
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,060
quick recap

3496
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,680
of how

3497
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:37,940

3498
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,360
works

3499
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,020
anybody

3500
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:41,440
seen this

3501
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:41,760
before

3502
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,000
if you've

3503
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,380
taken a

3504
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:43,640
network

3505
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:43,920
course

3506
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,280
you should

3507
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:44,400
have

3508
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:44,600
seen

3509
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:44,920
this

3510
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,100
allowing

3511
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:48,500
a few

3512
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:48,800
of you

3513
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,100
look

3514
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,260
familiar

3515
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:50,580
with

3516
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:50,800
this

3517
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,440
okay

3518
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:52,720
this

3519
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:52,920
is

3520
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,460
the

3521
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,340
IP

3522
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:56,680
before

3523
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:56,980
heaven

3524
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,880
this

3525
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,120
is

3526
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,580
this

3527
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,780
first

3528
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,240
one

3529
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:05,720
two

3530
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,180
three

3531
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:06,580
four

3532
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,060
five

3533
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,300
the

3534
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:07,760
five

3535
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,040
lines

3536
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:09,740
are

3537
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,320
the

3538
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:10,520
head

3539
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,040
this

3540
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,200
is

3541
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,640
options

3542
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,380
they may

3543
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:12,600
or may

3544
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:12,880
not be

3545
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,300
present

3546
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,360
okay

3547
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,020
but the

3548
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,280
first

3549
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,660
five

3550
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,140
are always

3551
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,440
there

3552
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,720
okay

3553
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,240
and

3554
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,120
it's

3555
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,280
like

3556
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,500
this

3557
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:20,700
it's

3558
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,020
32

3559
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:21,300
bits

3560
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:21,480
per

3561
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:21,780
line

3562
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,320
so

3563
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:25,880
the

3564
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,080
very

3565
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,440
first

3566
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:26,720
thing

3567
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:26,880
you

3568
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,100
see

3569
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:27,240
in

3570
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:27,320
the

3571
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:27,540
header

3572
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,160
is

3573
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:28,300
a

3574
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:28,520
version

3575
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:28,880
number

3576
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,820
now

3577
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,160
do you

3578
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:33,340
know

3579
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,220
how many

3580
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:34,460
versions

3581
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,820
of IP

3582
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,160
are there

3583
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:43,380
that's

3584
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:43,540
a

3585
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,380
for one

3586
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:44,620
word

3587
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:44,920
answer

3588
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,200
you're

3589
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,420
both

3590
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:45,700
right

3591
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:45,840
and

3592
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,140
wrong

3593
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,200
which

3594
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,000
rarely

3595
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,600
happens

3596
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,480
so

3597
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:51,680
the

3598
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:51,900
six

3599
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,040
is

3600
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,160
the

3601
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:52,320
right

3602
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:52,780
answer

3603
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,300
because

3604
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:54,440
there

3605
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:54,940
exists

3606
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,280
in

3607
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,000
IPv6

3608
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,220
but

3609
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:57,480
there's

3610
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:57,760
not a

3611
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,120
conclusion

3612
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,580
there's

3613
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:58,760
ever

3614
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:58,980
been

3615
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,240
six

3616
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,500
version

3617
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,620
nobody's

3618
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:00,980
ever heard

3619
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,320
of one

3620
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:01,700
and two

3621
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,180
and I

3622
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,180
don't think

3623
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:04,780
even three

3624
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,300
there's

3625
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,020
IPv4

3626
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,400
and there's

3627
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,200
IPv6

3628
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:10,600
and

3629
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,160
IPv5

3630
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,540
is like

3631
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:12,840
some

3632
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,020
lost

3633
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,580
you

3634
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:14,600
you

3635
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:14,800
know

3636
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,140
I

3637
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:15,220
don't

3638
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:15,720
upward

3639
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,480
effort

3640
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:17,780
that

3641
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:17,980
never

3642
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,280
saw

3643
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:18,420
the

3644
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:18,600
light

3645
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:18,840
of it

3646
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:18,980
so

3647
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,080
I

3648
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:19,180
don't

3649
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:19,300
know

3650
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:19,420
what

3651
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:19,660
happened

3652
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:19,920
to

3653
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,060
the

IPv5

3655
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,200
I

3656
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,400
never

3657
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:21,580
heard

3658
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:21,860
of it

3659
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,260
there

3660
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:22,400
is

3661
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:22,800
before

3662
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:22,960
and

3663
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,840
both

3664
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,020
of

3665
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,220
them

3666
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:25,980
believe it or not

3667
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,240
like

today

3672
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,240

you will

3682
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,120
see that

3683
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,640
you probably

3684
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,140
have both

3685
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:38,920
an IPv6

3686
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,700
and IPv4

3687
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,040
address

3688
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,900
depending on

3689
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,300
where you

3690
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:41,540
are

3691
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,020
which network

3692
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,400
you're using

3693
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:42,640
yeah

3694
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,780
no

3695
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,480
no

3696
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,400
no

3697
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:47,720
because

3698
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,240
and I

3699
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,440
thought

3700
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,000
you want

3701
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,220
to know

3702
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:49,500
why

3703
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,620
because

3704
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,160
this is

3705
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,340
the

3706
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:51,720
within

3707
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,100
waste

3708
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,100
this is

3709
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:53,500
the only

3710
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,300
changing

3711
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:54,740
IP

3712
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,920
is like

3713
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,220
moving

3714
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:56,700
mountains

3715
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,140
okay

3716
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:58,620
it's a

3717
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,180
humongous

3718
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,700
undertaking

3719
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,740
people thought

3720
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:01,080
about it

3721
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:01,700
for decades

3722
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,640
because IP

3723
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,640
has fundamental

3724
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,100
issues

3725
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:04,480
no matter

3726
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,020
what version

3727
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,440
it is

3728
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,040
it's a fundamental

3729
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,300
issue

3730
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,380
to change

3731
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:07,840
to something

3732
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,280
other than

3733
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:08,580
IP

3734
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:09,420
requires

3735
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,980
incredible

3736
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,320
effort

3737
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,420
okay

3738
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,280
that's why

3739
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,240
with SSL

3740
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,620
TLS

3741
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,080
it's much

3742
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,420
easier

3743
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,040
with

3744
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,880
Kerber

3745
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,340
it's much

3746
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:18,560
easier

3747
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,320
this application

3748
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:19,820
things

3749
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,880
moving things

3750
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,360
in the network

3751
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,400
is very high

3752
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,760
moving things

3753
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,120
evolving things

3754
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,560
here

3755
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,140
easy

3756
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,580
that's

3757
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:29,900
hop by

3758
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,120
hop

3759
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,420
you can

3760
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:30,740
do it

3761
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,020
on your

3762
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,240
own

3763
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:31,520
in your

3764
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:31,820
home

3765
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,540
install

3766
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:32,840
some

3767
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,320
weird

3768
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:33,700
ass

3769
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,740
custom

3770
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,220

3771
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,160
data link

3772
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,440
layer

3773
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:36,940
that you

3774
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,380
designed

3775
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,660
nobody cares

3776
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,220
nobody cares

3777
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:40,600
maybe your

3778
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,060
neighbors care

3779
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,700
but you know

3780
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:42,960
what I mean

3781
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,540
you're totally

3782
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,020
free to do

3783
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,240
that

3784
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,960
you want

3785
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,320
to put

3786
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,080
pigeons

3787
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,440
in the

3788
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,040
physical layer

3789
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:48,500
that carry

3790
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,360
IP packets

3791
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,720
you know

3792
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,880
no problem

3793
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,680
do it

3794
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,180
but

3795
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:52,980
yeah

3796
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:53,300
serious

3797
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:53,820
you can do

3798
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,020
it

3799
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,900
nobody cares

3800
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,600
except

3801
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,060
people

3802
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,240
get pooped

3803
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:57,420
on

3804
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:57,960
but

3805
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,240
network

3806
00:51:59,240 --> 00:51:59,520
layer

3807
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,120
is where

3808
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:00,500
it's

3809
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:00,880
common

3810
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,240
and so

3811
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:01,640
it's

3812
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,080
impossible

3813
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,860
let me put it

3814
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,180
this way

3815
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:05,840
you all

3816
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,360
got a lot

3817
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:06,680
of years

3818
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:06,920
ahead

3819
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,980
I would

3820
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,580
be super

3821
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:08,960
duper

3822
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,560
surprised

3823
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,600
if there's

3824
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,400
IPV7

3825
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,020
or anything

3826
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:12,700
higher than

3827
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,000
6

3828
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,880
in your

3829
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,340
lifetime

3830
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,900
of course

3831
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,340
never say

3832
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:16,540
no

3833
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:16,820
never

3834
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,100
but

3835
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:17,760
I would

3836
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,600
be really

3837
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,020
surprised

3838
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,500
because

3839
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:19,700
it's

3840
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,060
such a

3841
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,260
hard

3842
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:20,460
thing

3843
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,620
yeah

3844
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,160
but let's

3845
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,500
keep our

3846
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:27,820
eye on the

3847
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,020
ball

3848
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:28,360
what

3849
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:28,920
IP

3850
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,280
before

3851
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,640
remember

3852
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,120
designed

3853
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,500
in like

3854
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:30,760
early

3855
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,360
80s

3856
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:32,600
they

3857
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:32,820
thought

3858
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,320
jeez

3859
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,000
we have

3860
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,140
5,000

3861
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,840
10,000

3862
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,320
hosts

3863
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:36,620
on the

3864
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,060
internet

3865
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,580
32 bits

3866
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,780
is enough

3867
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,480
for an

3868
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:40,880
address

3869
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,520
32 bits

3870
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:43,980
2 to the

3871
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,320
32

3872
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:44,820
right

3873
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,660
big number

3874
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,860
wrong

3875
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,980
not such a

3876
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,340
big number

3877
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:49,800
after all

3878
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,180
so

3879
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,540
already

3880
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,360
by the

3881
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,120
decade

3882
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,520
later

3883
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:53,740
like

3884
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:54,000
maybe

3885
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,300
like

3886
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:54,820

ah

3892
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:57,340

we're

3911
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,000

3915
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,900
the

truth

3917

00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:06,640
actually

3919
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:06,980
they never

did

3921
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,700
and

3922
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:08,980
we still

3923
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:09,160
use

3924
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:09,480
before

3925
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:09,680
which

3926
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:09,860
means

3927
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:10,020
we

3928
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:10,220
didn't

3929
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:10,480

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:10,780

00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:36,720
they

00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:38,720
so

3995
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,200
we

3996
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,400
wound

3997
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:39,520

00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:43,980
still

00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:14,340
the

4096

4098
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:14,900

4100
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,700

4101
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,460
now

4102
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:17,560
I

4103
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:17,700
know

4104
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:17,820
what

4105
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:17,900
to

4106
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,100
do

4107
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,340
IHL

4108
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:20,900

00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,300

4111
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,040
length

4112
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,920
it's

4113
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,120

right

4117
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:28,800
so

4118
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,240
not a lot

4119
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,560
it just

4120
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,000
tells you

4121
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,940
how many

4122
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,340

let's

4201
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:09,360
say

4208
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,660
more like

4210
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,680

00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,160

4215
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:17,620
is out

4216
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,200
is it

4217
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,860
because

4218
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,660
it was

4219
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:22,860
like

4220
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,200
very

4221
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,740

4222
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,500
that

4223
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,280
it

4224
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:26,560
seems

4225
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,860
like

4226
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,520
odd

4227
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:27,860
that

4228
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,900
they

4229
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,040
would

4230
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,300
waste

4231
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:29,480
so

4232
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:29,640
many

five

4237
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:31,980
rather

4238
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,100

4239
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:32,640
oh

4240
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:32,800
no

4241
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:32,980
no

4242
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:33,180
it's

4243
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:33,320
not

4246
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,840
it's

always

4249
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:35,460
it could

4250
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:35,580

00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:35,980

4252
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:36,300
it could

be

4254
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:36,700
longer

4255
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:36,980
because

4256
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,140
of

4257
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:37,640

4258
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,340
it

right

4266
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,180
so

4267
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:41,420
it

4268
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:41,620

that's

4276
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:43,480
right

4277
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:43,640
I

4278
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,200
well

4279
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:44,480
wait

4280
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:44,760
a minute

4281
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,040
I

4282
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,600
don't

me

4285
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,480
I used

4286
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:47,600

4287
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:47,760

this

4289
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,200
I

4290
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:48,380
should

4291
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,540
look

4292
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:48,780
back

4293
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,160
it

4294
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:49,380
may

00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:49,540
be

4296
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:49,780

4302
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:51,360
it

4303
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:51,640
counts

4304
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:51,920
over

4305
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,400
five

4306
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,300
but

4307
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:53,980
it

4308
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,180
has

4309
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:54,300
to

4310
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:54,540
have

4311
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:54,700
the

4312
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:54,980
length

4313
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,420
and

4314
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:56,820
I'm

4315
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,060
pretty

4316
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,380
sure

4317
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:57,720
that

4318
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,300
let's

4319
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:58,520
see

4320
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:58,840
one

4321
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,180
two

4322
00:55:59,180 --> 00:55:59,820
four

4323
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:00,160
the

4324
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,340
other

4325
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:04,680
question

4326
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:04,860
is

4327
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,000
why

4328
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,200
would

4329
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,380
you need

4330
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:05,520
the

4331
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:05,880
IHL

4332
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,060
if you

4333
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:06,160
have

4334
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,280
the

4335
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:06,420
total

4336
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:06,640
length

4337
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:06,900
anyway

4338
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,260
why

4339
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:09,540
do

4340
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:09,760
you

4341
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,020
need

4342
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,260
to

4343
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:10,700
ah

4344
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,100
total

4345
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:11,540
length

4346
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:11,960
is

4347
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,680
including

4348
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:12,900
the

4349
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,200
data

4350
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,700
that

4351
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,260
includes

4352
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:16,860
the

4353
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,080
data

4354
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:17,280
that

4355
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:17,760
I'll show

4356
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:17,980
you

4357
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,800
okay

4358
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,280
below

4359
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:19,740
this

4360
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,440
that's

4361
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:20,540
the

4362
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:20,700
header

4363
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:20,960
below

4364
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,240
this

4365
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,380
is

4366
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:21,500
the

4367
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:21,740
data

4368
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,260
so

4369
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:23,600
that's

4370
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:23,960
a

4371
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,160
different

4372
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:24,400
bit

4373
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:24,740
and

4374
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,080
that's

4375
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:25,440
16

4376
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:25,760
bits

4377
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,240
so

4378
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:26,800
the

4379
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,220
maximum

4380
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:27,540
you could

4381
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:27,760
ever

4382
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,140
transmit

4383
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:28,520

4384
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:28,840

4385
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,060
is

4386
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:29,280
2 to

4387
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:29,360
the

00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,260
IP

4390
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:30,500
does

4391
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:30,760
not

4392
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,020
tell

4393
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:31,380
you

4394
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,500
how

4395
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:33,900
big

4396
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,180
a

4398
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:34,880
can

4399
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,180
be

4400
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,320
up to

4401
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:36,560
that

4402
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,240
cannot

4403
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:37,400
be

4404
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:37,600
built

4405
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,020
above

4406
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:38,540
you

4407
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:38,680
know

4408
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:38,840
2

4409
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:38,860
to

4410
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,180
the

4413
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,100
1

4414
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,780
but

4415
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,340
it

4416
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:46,460
can

4417
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:46,620
be

4418
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,160
less

4419
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:47,680
and

4420
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,080
that's

4421
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:48,540
determined

4422
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,020
by

4423
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:49,700
that's

4424
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:49,900
again

4425
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,160
more

4426
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:50,300

4427
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:50,400
you

4428
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:50,520
want

4429
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:50,600
to

4430
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:50,780
know

4431
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,000
but

4432
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,200

4433
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:51,660

00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:51,980

it

4453
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,060
so

4454
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,220

4459
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:02,500
it's

4463
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,080
okay

4464
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:06,400
there are

4465
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,540

smaller

4470
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:09,460

4474
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,600
is essentially

4475
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:12,960
like a

it

4480
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,180

make sense

4647
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:39,780
yeah

4648
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,340

this

4655
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:43,720

00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:45,580
piece

4659
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:45,720

4662
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:46,340
is

4663
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:46,660
this

4664
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,200

4665
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:49,560

4666
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:49,780

4669
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,420

4670
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,360

4671
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,460

4672
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,160
not always

4673
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:54,960

4674
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,820
to 255

4675
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,180
that's the

00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:56,340
only

4677
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,040

4678
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,280
you can

4679
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:57,760
put there

4680
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,940

4683
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,260
and it's

4684
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:00,820
decremented

4685
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,620

4691
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,440
the

reason

4693
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:04,880
it's

4694
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,080
there

4695
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,340
is to

4696
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:05,700
avoid

4697
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,320
loops

4698
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,100

loops

4700
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:07,820
and all kinds

4701
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,180
of weird

4703
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,200
things that

00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:09,460
used to

00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:09,700
happen

4706
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:09,940

internet

4708
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,720
right

4709
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:11,980
if you

4710
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,160
don't

4711
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:12,540
have it

4712
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:12,820
then

4713
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,260
in theory

4714
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,100
a packet

4715
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:15,340

4719
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,860
like in

4720
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,280
a maze

4721
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,040
so

4722
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:20,420
once it

4723
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:20,660
reaches

4724
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,080
zero

4725
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,500
the router

4726
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,060
that receives

4727
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,260
it

4728
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:23,880
and decrements

4729
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,100
it to

4730
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:24,380
zero

4731
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,240
discards

4732
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:25,640
the packet

4733
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:33,180
also because

4734
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:33,800
that consumes

4735
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,340
resources

4736
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:34,740
right

4737
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,880
protocol

4738
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,180
protocol means

4739
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:37,720
not IP

4740
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,700
what is the

4741
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,360
next protocol

4742
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,960
which transport

4743
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,180
layer

4744
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:41,520
which

4745
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:41,920
which

4746
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,500
which protocol

4747
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:43,980
is going to

4748
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,560
handle this

4749
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,320
packet after

4750
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:45,680
IP

4751
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,520
when it

4752
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,960
goes up

4753
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,360
remember

4754
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,240
packet is

4755
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:50,740
received at

4756
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,360
the destination

4757
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,040
goes for the

4758
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,780
physical layer

4759
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,040
right

4760
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:54,260
then

4761
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,220
from physical

4762
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,440
layer

4763
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:55,700
to the

4764
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,060
data link

4765
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:56,240
layer

4766
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:56,680
I hand it

4767
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,060
over to

4768
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:57,360
IP

4769
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:57,700
IP

4770
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,200
does its

4771
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:58,460
thing

4772
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:58,820
and says

4773
00:59:58,820 --> 00:59:59,260
what do I

4774
00:59:59,260 --> 00:59:59,480
do with

4775
00:59:59,480 --> 00:59:59,840
it next

4776
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,760
protocol

4777
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,360
tells it

4778
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,800
okay

4779
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,600
it invokes

4780
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,320
the appropriate

4781
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:04,800
function

4782
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,820
if it's a

4783
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,480
TCP packet

4784
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:06,860
it calls

4785
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,220
TCP

4786
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:07,640
received

4787
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,140
if it's a

4788
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,840
UDPAC packet

4789
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,180
it calls

4790
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:09,500
UDP

4791
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:09,900
received

4792
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:10,600

4793
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,540

4794
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,120
checksum

4795
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,080
header

4796
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,600
checksum

4797
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,360
is a very

4798
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,020
very silly

4799
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:15,680
value

4800
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,700
it's a

4801
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,740
once complement

4802
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:18,160
of once

4803
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:18,600
complement

4804
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,380
of XOR

4805
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,120
of all

4806
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,520
the 16

4807
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,720
bit

4808
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,340
values

4809
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:24,620
like

4810
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,160
fold it

4811
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:25,360
here

4812
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,080
it's a

4813
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:26,340
terrible

4814
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:26,760
it's a

4815
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,080
checksum

4816
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:27,340

4818
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,200
basically

4819
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,840
it catches

4820
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,720
benign errors

4821
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,740
like if

4822
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,920
routers used

4823
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,340
to be very

4824
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:35,980
unreliable

4825
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:36,340
and once

4826
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:36,600
another

4827
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,120
flip a

4828
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,320
bit

4829
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,700
well if

4830
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,040
you flip

4831
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,340
a bit

4832
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:39,600
in the

4833
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:39,840
header

4834
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,300
you know

4835
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:40,660
you can

4836
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:40,900
like

4837
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,500
change

4838
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:41,640
the

4839
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,140

4840
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:42,460

source

4842
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,340
so

4843
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:43,860
the reason

4844
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:44,340
checksum

4845
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:44,640
is there

4846
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:44,920
is to

4847
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,160
catch

4848
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:45,400
such

4849
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:45,760
errors

4850
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:45,920
in

4851
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,340
routers

4852
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:46,800
and

4853
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,020
throw

4854
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,160
away

4855
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:47,280
the

4857
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,200
but it's

4858
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:49,460
not

4859
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:49,800
supposed

4860
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:49,980
to

4861
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,360
protect

4862
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:50,740

01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:25,900
about

4926
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:26,180
timing

4927
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:26,360
so

4928
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,080
you use

4929
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:27,280
what's

4930
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:27,400
called

4931
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:27,680
timing

4932
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,020
option

4933
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:28,440
it records

4934
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:28,900
the time

4935
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:29,200
to get

4936
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:29,580
to this

4937
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:29,840
hop

4938
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,480
the second

4939
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:30,720
hop

4940
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,100
the third

4941
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:31,340
hop

4942
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:31,680
all the way

4943
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:31,820
to the

4944
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,260
destination

4945
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,140
trace

4946
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:34,460
route

4947
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:34,680
is

4948
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:34,860
used

4949
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:35,400
record

4950
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:35,700
route

4951
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,100
option

4952
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:36,420
which

4953
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:36,640
tells

4954
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:36,800
you

4955
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,540
exact

4956
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,000
route

4957
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,620
that

4958
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:39,000
the packet

4959
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,380
takes

4960
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:39,720
as it

4961
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:39,940
gets

4962
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,060
to

4963
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:40,180
the

4964
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:40,600
destination

4965
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,900
so

4966
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,180
every

4967
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:42,480
router

4968
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:47,680
okay

4969
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,020
most packets

4970
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:50,680
normal packets

4971
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,040
don't have

4972
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,340
options

4973
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,500
everything you

4974
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:53,980
see in red

4975
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,480
this should be

4976
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,080
red

4977
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,760
not blue

4978
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,660
everything you

4979
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,220
see in red

4980
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,060
changes

4981
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,040
hop by hop

4982
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,800
or at least

4983
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,600
can't change

4984
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,340
time to live

4985
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,060
always changes

4986
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,200
for every hop

4987
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,540
fragment offset

4988
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,420
can change

4989
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,000
if a router

4990
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,700
refragments

4991
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,140
the packet

4992
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,160
for example

4993
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:15,500
if you see

4994
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:15,860
the packet

4995
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,380
of 1500

4996
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,100
bytes

4997
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:17,620
and the

4998
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:18,080
next hop

4999
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,560
only takes

5000
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,320
800 bytes

5001
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:19,800
maximum

5002
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,520
so you

5003
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:20,740
have to

5004
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,280
split that

5005
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:21,620
in two

5006
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,940
and that

5007
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:23,300
changes

5008
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:23,720
the header

5009
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:24,100
checksum

5010
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:24,480
will change

5011
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:24,720
too

5012
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,220
in fact

5013
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:25,460
the header

5014
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:25,780
checksum

5015
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,100
changes

5016
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:26,640
anytime

5017
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,000
anyway

5018
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,300
because

5019
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:27,800
time to live

5020
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,180
changes

5021
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:28,840
yeah

5022
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:33,960
absolutely

5023
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,360
absolutely

5024
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,240
it should

5025
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:36,600
change

5026
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,120
but I think

5027
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,240
IHL is not

5028
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:38,820
including the

5029
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,140
options

5030
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:40,640
I think

5031
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,220
it is

5032
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:42,820
I think

5033
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:43,120
it's back

5034
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:43,400
to his

5035
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:43,680
question

5036
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,100
why is it

5037
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:44,440
five

5038
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,020
I think

5039
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:45,240
it is

5040
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:45,460
just

5041
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:45,800
waste

5042
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,240
but I

5043
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:47,460
double

5044
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:47,760
check

5045
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,420
my memory

5046
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,100
is just

5047
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:50,360
like

5048
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,800
why

5049
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,220
yeah

5050
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:53,880
I looked

5051
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,120
it up

5052
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:54,900
it has

5053
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:55,220
to be

5054
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:55,580
like the

5055
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:55,820
minimum

5056
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:56,240
value

5057
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:56,500
is

5058
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,000
five

5059
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,940
and the

5060
01:02:58,940 --> 01:02:59,160
max

5061
01:02:59,160 --> 01:02:59,760
is 15

5062
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,360
max

5063
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:00,960
is 15

5064
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,480
but

5065
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,700
I think

5066
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,240
he's right

5067
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:04,760
because if

5068
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,340
you record

5069
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:05,840
the route

5070
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,300
it will go

5071
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:07,920
over 15

5072
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,840
so I have to

5073
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,240
look up the

5074
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:09,760
answer to that

5075
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,080
question

5076
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:10,600
what happens

5077
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:10,980
I think

5078
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,000
I think

5079
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,620
I think

5080
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:11,900
it should

5081
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,200
not

5082
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:12,440
but

5083
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,120
don't know

5084
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,300
anyway

5085
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:15,660
so

5086
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,440
one of the

5087
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:17,760
things I

5088
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,260
point out

5089
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:18,720
is these

5090
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,760
red fields

5091
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,100
they can

5092
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:20,500
change

5093
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,260
in transit

5094
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,080
okay

5095
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:23,460
the other

5096
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:23,960
fields must

5097
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,600
be the same

5098
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:29,440
IPv6

5099
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,140
in contrast

5100
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,340
very different

5101
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:31,940
but notice

5102
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,540
the version number

5103
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:32,800
right

5104
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,780
that's the

5105
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,380
common language

5106
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:34,840
they have

5107
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,820
see the version

5108
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,040
number

5109
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:36,360
in the very

5110
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:36,660
corner

5111
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,920
same

5112
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,620
same field

5113
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,020
same

5114
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:39,640
same length

5115
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,500
this is how

5116
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:40,780
you know

5117
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,580
oh IPv6

5118
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,340
IPv4

5119
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:42,760
yeah

5120
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,900
when you say

5121
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,520
you can't

5122
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:44,820
change the

5123
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:45,040
route

5124
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:45,960
are you

5125
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,480
including

5126
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:46,820
like

5127
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:47,540
adding

5128
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,680
routers

5129
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,000
because that

5130
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,300
would change

5131
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:49,820
the source

5132
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:50,920
or destination

5133
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,240
shouldn't

5134
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:53,480
right

5135
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,140
because IPv

5136
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:54,460
was designed

5137
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,020
before NAT

5138
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:55,640
yeah

5139
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,580
yes

5140
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:57,020
of course

5141
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:57,460
NATs are

5142
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:57,860
an exception

5143
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,320
I mean

5144
01:03:59,320 --> 01:03:59,600
you could

5145
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,280
always do

5146
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:00,700
things that

5147
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:00,940
you're not

5148
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:01,460
supposed to

5149
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:01,660
right

5150
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:02,040
in a way

5151
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,120
but NAT

5152
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:03,660
was originally

5153
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:04,160
a hack

5154
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,320
that people

5155
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:05,720
frowned

5156
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,000
upon

5157
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,280
now

5158
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:06,620
it's a

5159
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:06,880
standard

5160
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,220
2

5161
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:07,680
so it

5162
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,300
co-exists

5163
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,100
yeah

5164
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,140
okay

5165
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:11,720
so now

5166
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,560
notice

5167
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,380
no options

5168
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,040
anymore

5169
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,120
notice

5170
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:15,820
no fragments

5171
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:16,240
anymore

5172
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,340
much cleaner

5173
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:18,900
design

5174
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,540
destination

5175
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:21,920
that is

5176
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,660
128

5177
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,160
source

5178
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:23,480
that is

5179
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:23,980
128

5180
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:24,760
we'll not

5181
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,140
run out

5182
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:25,580
of that

5183
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:26,620
there probably

5184
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,600
you know

5185
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,220
more than

5186
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:29,880
grains of sand

5187
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,200
on this

5188
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:30,460
earth

5189
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,200
right

5190
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,280
2 to the

5191
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:33,680
128

5192
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,220
is a giant

5193
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:34,540
number

5194
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:35,860
payload

5195
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,420
length

5196
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,260
that's the

5197
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:37,440
length

5198
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:37,660
of a

5199
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:37,820
payload

5200
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:38,160
you don't

5201
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:38,660
need the

5202
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:38,960
internet

5203
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,240
header

5204
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:39,540
length

5205
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,560
because it's

5206
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:40,860
fixed

5207
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,300
so a

5208
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:41,560
payload

5209
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:41,860
length

5210
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:42,260
is everything

5211
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:42,580
that comes

5212
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:42,860
after

5213
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,960
next header

5214
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,400
next header

5215
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:46,700
means

5216
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:47,140
particle

5217
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:47,620
which

5218
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:47,960
particle

5219
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,240
is going

5220
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:48,660
to end up

5221
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,320
in the

5222
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:49,560
header

5223
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:49,900
after

5224
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:50,660
meaning

5225
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,100
whatever

5226
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:52,440
starts

5227
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:52,900
here

5228
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,240
right

5229
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,100
is not

5230
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:55,300
just

5231
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:55,940
playing data

5232
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:56,420
it's another

5233
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:56,800
particle

5234
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,320
like

5235
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:57,800
transport

5236
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,300
or

5237
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:58,640
another

5238
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,520
or something

5239
01:04:59,520 --> 01:04:59,820
else

5240
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,460
so you

5241
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:00,720
need to

5242
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,060
tell

5243
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:02,380
the

5244
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:02,580
IP

5245
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:02,820
header

5246
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:03,680
to which

5247
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:03,940
particle

5248
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:04,340
to pass

5249
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:04,560
this

5250
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,080
next

5251
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,740
hop limit

5252
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,320
that's the

5253
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,020
time to live

5254
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:08,720
that's still

5255
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,200
there

5256
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,080
right

5257
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:10,540
but it's

5258
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,080
2,

5259
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:11,360
3,

5260
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:11,680
4,

5261
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,080
5,

5262
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:12,460
6,

5263
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:12,700
7,

5264
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,080
8

5265
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:13,460
now

5266
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,240
ok

5267
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:15,540
same

5268
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,940
shouldn't

5269
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:17,340
be hopping

5270
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:17,660
too much

5271
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:18,260
but in fact

5272
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:18,620
the number

5273
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:18,880
of hops

5274
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,100
on the

5275
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:19,360
internet

5276
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:19,860
has gone

5277
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,200
down

5278
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:20,580
over the

5279
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:20,860
years

5280
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,020
you know

5281
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:22,320
why

5282
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,180
big ASPs

5283
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,140
big giant

5284
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:25,640
ASPs

5285
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,000
long haul

5286
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,780
lines

5287
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:28,740
without

5288
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:29,160
problems

5289
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:29,360
right

5290
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:29,680
so you

5291
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,160
can basically

5292
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:30,660
do one

5293
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:30,980
hop

5294
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:31,800
and cross

5295
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,340
most of

5296
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:32,700
the US

5297
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,020
in one

5298
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:33,200
hop

5299
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,780
so

5300
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,440
if you

5301
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:35,640
do

5302
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,240
just for

5303
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:36,540
fun

5304
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,160
pick your

5305
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,120
most exotic

5306
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:38,540
location

5307
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:38,740
in

5308
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:38,920
India

5309
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,240
you can

5310
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:39,580
think of

5311
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:39,800
like

5312
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,140
again

5313
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,500
Slabonia

5314
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,060
or Kravistan

5315
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:43,600
somewhere

5316
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:43,880
and

5317
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,440
try

5318
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:44,760
to do

5319
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:44,880
a

5320
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,160
tracer

5321
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:45,500
you

5322
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:45,720
won't

5323
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:45,940
see

5324
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:46,220
that

5325
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:46,460
many

5326
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:46,780
hops

5327
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,320
surprisingly

5328
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,080
anyway

5329
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:49,440
flow

5330
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:49,840

5331
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,640

5332
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,000
class

5333
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,240
is

5334
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:52,620

5379
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:05,660

5422
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,400
but

5423
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:35,580
there's

5424
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:35,720
no

01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:36,600
such

5428
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:36,900
right

5429
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,260
because

5430
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:38,660
IP

5431
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:38,800

5433
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,640
okay

5434
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:41,820
so

5435
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:42,000
this

5436
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,120
is

5437
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:42,300
just

5438
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:42,420

things

5447
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,980
so

5448
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:47,300
yes

5449
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:47,920

5452
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:48,640
longer

5453
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,180
because

5454
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:49,360
the

01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:50,080
much

5458
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:50,400
longer

5459
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,300
but

5460
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:51,580
in

5461
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:51,760

5464
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:52,960
its

5465
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,260
format

5466
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:53,500
it's

5467
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:53,840
cleaner

5468
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,380

5469
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:54,780
right

5470
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,900
so

5471
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,160
in

5472
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:57,260

this

5476
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:57,840
we're

5755
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:10,940

but

5759
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:12,240
when

5760
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:12,360
you

5761
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:12,500
are

5764
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:13,740
it

5765
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:13,980
is

01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:14,700

5767
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:14,940
right

5768
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:15,640
it is

5769
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:15,840

5771
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:16,420
so

5772
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:16,620
there is

5773
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:16,780

5776
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,640
so

5777
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,080
you

5778
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:19,220
see

5779
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:19,360
how

01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:19,640

you

5796
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:24,280
want

5797
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:24,380
to

5798
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:24,600

01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,060
your

away

5804
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,220
you

5805
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:27,320
don't

5806
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:27,420
want

5807
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:27,540

5808
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:27,780

5810
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:28,320

5811
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:28,500
your

01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:28,760
letters

5813
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:28,920
you

5814
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,020
know

5815
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:29,100
what

5816
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:29,280
means

5817
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:29,680
blind

5818
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:29,880
and

5819
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,120
stupid

5820
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:30,860
right

5821
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:31,180
so

5822
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:31,420
there is

5823
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:31,520
a

5824
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:31,780
different

01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,100

5828
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:33,520
much

5829
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:33,740
more

5830
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:34,160
relaxed

5831
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,480
right

5832
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:35,660
when

5833
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:35,840
you're

5834
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,260
downloading

5835
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:36,480
your

5836
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:36,800
file

5837
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,740
the

5838
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:39,040
delay

5839
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,400
requirements

5840
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:39,680
are not

5841
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:39,840
that

5842
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,280
stringent

5843
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:40,840
so

5844
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,020
there's

5845
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:41,140
all

5846
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:41,380
different

5847
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:41,780
qualities

5848
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:41,980
of

5850
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:42,920
my

5851
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:43,240
guess

5852
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:43,420
is

5853
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:43,880
because

5854
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,100
of

5855
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:44,820
changing

5856
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:45,100
that

5857
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:45,420
quality

5858
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:45,600
of

5859
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:45,900
service

5860
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:46,580
field

5861
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:46,980
you

5862
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:47,200
get

5863
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:47,560
different

5864
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:47,900
routes

5865
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,100
I

5866
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:49,260
don't

5867
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:49,480
think

5868
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:49,680
by

5869
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,040
changing

5870
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:50,400
packet

5871
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:50,920
lengths

5872
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,840
I

5873
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,280
assume

5874
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:52,480
you're

5875
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:52,680
talking

5876
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:52,860
about

5877
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:53,080
same

5878
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,360
source

5879
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:53,560
same

5880
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,040
destination

5881
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:54,400
right

5882
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,680
yeah

5883
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,020
I can

5884
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:56,180
see

5885
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:56,400
that

5886
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:56,800
and

5887
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:56,920
you

5888
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:57,040
could

5889
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:57,420
definitely

5890
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:58,200
change

5891
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,300
traverse

5892
01:09:59,300 --> 01:09:59,680
different

5893
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,160
countries

5894
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,880
right

5895
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,680
by changing

5896
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:02,920
so

5897
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:03,300
again

5898
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:03,660
if you're

5899
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:03,940
within

5900
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,220
one

5901
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:04,700
country

5902
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,300
I mean

5903
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:06,680
political

5904
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:07,060
entity

5905
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:07,480
I don't

5906
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:07,860
see that

5907
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:08,180
happening

5908
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:08,480
so

5909
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,020
I

5910
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:09,420
suspect

5911
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:09,740
what you're

5912
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:09,980
talking

5913
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:10,200
about

5914
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:10,480
since you

5915
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:10,640
said

5916
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,100
censorship

5917
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,120
that this

5918
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:12,480
would be

5919
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:12,960
across

5920
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:13,700
borders

5921
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,220
but

5922
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:16,500
anyway

5923
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,700
maybe not

5924
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,000
I mean

5925
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:18,520
if you're

5926
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:18,880
already in

5927
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,220
a country

5928
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:19,640
that does

5929
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,020
censorship

5930
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:20,320
maybe

5931
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,220
that doesn't

5932
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:21,420
work

5933
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,100
so

5934
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,180
the

5935
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:24,500
security

5936
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:24,840
model

5937
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:25,260
for IP

5938
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:25,520
yeah

5939
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,060
sorry

5940
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:26,380
just very

5941
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:26,780
quickly

5942
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,400
do

5943
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,540
users

5944
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,620
or I guess

5945
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:30,960
both the

5946
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:31,460
server and

5947
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,000
the client

5948
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:32,820
do they

5949
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:33,320
get to

5950
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:33,680
choose

5951
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,020
what type

5952
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:34,400
of traffic

5953
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:34,700
they are

5954
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,120
doesn't that

5955
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:35,640
violate

5956
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,320
the security

5957
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:36,780
principle

5958
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:37,040
about

5959
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:37,600
resources

5960
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,580
in IP

5961
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:39,360
yeah

5962
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:39,760
well

5963
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,080
no no

5964
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:40,160
no

5965
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:40,660
that's not

5966
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:40,820
like

5967
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,300
SSL

5968
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:41,680
TLS

5969
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:41,960
right

5970
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,160
or

5971
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:42,500
HTTP

5972
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,420
in IP

5973
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:44,220
layer

5974
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,080
you don't

5975
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:45,900
really choose

5976
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,300
it's more

5977
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:46,600
like

5978
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,200
first of all

5979
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:48,540
there's no

5980
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:48,780
server

5981
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:49,140
client

5982
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,260
I mean

5983
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:50,840
like in

5984
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,140
the sense

5985
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:51,500
of like

5986
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:51,800
there's

5987
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:51,960
some

5988
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,080
resources

5989
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,400
right

5990
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:54,760
and there's

5991
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,240
some users

5992
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:55,940
yeah

5993
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:56,460
and

5994
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:56,740
so

5995
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:57,060
could you

5996
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,140
it's in their

5997
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:58,480
interest

5998
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:58,820
to like

5999
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,240
choose the

6000
01:10:59,240 --> 01:10:59,540
best

6001
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,540
yes

6002
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,160
are you

6003
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:02,520
saying

6004
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,300
can a

6005
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:03,920
user of

6006
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,540
a computer

6007
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,660
like a

6008
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:06,080
laptop

6009
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,840
hack into

6010
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,280
IP

6011
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,660
implementation

6012
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,220
locally

6013
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,460
and fix

6014
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,240
that field

6015
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:14,940
right

6016
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,680
and change

6017
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,040
IP

6018
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:16,720
so that

6019
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,620
it will

6020
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:18,300
always put

6021
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:18,900
the highest

6022
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,880
priority

6023
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,420
kind of

6024
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:20,640
UI

6025
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,480
yes

6026
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:21,500
yes

6027
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:21,940
you can

6028
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:22,600
get

6029
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:22,620
get

6030
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:23,500
yourself

6031
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,060
Linux

6032
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:24,840
hack

6033
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,000
it

6034
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,340
source

6035
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,060
available

6036
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:27,840
you can

6037
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,300
go into

6038
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:28,720
the IP

6039
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,400
implementation

6040
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:29,880
and do

6041
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,260
that

6042
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,700
I don't

6043
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,220
think there's

6044
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:32,600
any way

6045
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,080
to prevent

6046
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:33,400
that

6047
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,940
but

6048
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,440
the other

6049
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:37,780
way

6050
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:38,280
packets

6051
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:38,960
coming back

6052
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,500
may not

6053
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,180
care about

6054
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:42,520
what you

6055
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:42,700
say

6056
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:42,900
right

6057
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,240
so your

6058
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:43,560
packets

6059
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:43,780
might

6060
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:45,200
get a

6061
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:45,680
preferential

6062
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,100
treatment

6063
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:46,540
but the

6064
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:47,200
return packets

6065
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:47,920
won't

6066
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,440
unless you

6067
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:48,840
agree

6068
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,440
unless you

6069
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:49,700
hack

6070
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,020
both

6071
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:53,180
say I'm

6072
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:53,660
Netflix

6073
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,100
why would

6074
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:55,460
I not

6075
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:55,980
want to

6076
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,600
make my

6077
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,160
QS

6078
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:57,700
the best

6079
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,940
and sure

6080
01:11:58,940 --> 01:11:59,420
buffering

6081
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,220
but I don't

6082
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:00,780
want buffering

6083
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,800
for my

6084
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,500
users

6085
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,400
yeah I

6086
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,120
don't know

6087
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:06,680
you could

6088
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:07,260
I suspect

6089
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:07,780
you could

6090
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:08,740
can Netflix

6091
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:09,760
detect anything

6092
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,500
that you're

6093
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,100
messing with

6094
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:11,980
probably not

6095
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:12,680
no I mean

6096
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:13,360
from Netflix

6097
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,160
oh from

6098
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:14,440
Netflix

6099
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,340
well they have

6100
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:15,700
to be good

6101
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:16,500
corporate citizens

6102
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,600
right because

6103
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,040
people can

6104
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:18,660
inspect their

6105
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:19,080
packets

6106
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,540
right IP

6107
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,200
packet headers

6108
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:21,720
are visible

6109
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:25,060
so this packet

6110
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:25,920
inspection can

6111
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,620
say ISP

6112
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:27,040
will say

6113
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,280
they even

6114
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:28,700
Netflix

6115
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,560
themselves have

6116
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,320
a long distance

6117
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,320
at least ISP

6118
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,400
and like the

6119
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,160
borders Netflix

6120
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:33,800
right and they'll

6121
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,440
say what the

6122
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:34,780
hell are you

6123
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:35,120
doing

6124
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,680
you are choking

6125
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,180
all the other

6126
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:37,880
traffic out

6127
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,740
I mean they do

6128
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:41,300
they do

6129
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,120
but they still

6130
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:42,680
use the rest

6131
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:42,840
of the

6132
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,000
even if they

6133
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,480
are their own

6134
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:44,880
ISP

6135
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,380
I mean their

6136
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,100
border other

6137
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:46,480
what's called

6138
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:46,940
autonomous

6139
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:47,360
domains

6140
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,140
and those

6141
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:48,480
will come

6142
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:48,680
play

6143
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,260
so the

6144
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:50,720
IP security

6145
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,220
one is like

6146
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:51,420
this

6147
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:51,620
yeah

6148
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:52,900
I mean I

6149
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,380
will use the

6150
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,140
word machines

6151
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:54,640
hosts

6152
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,220
but what are

6153
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:55,580
we really

6154
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,200
talking about

6155
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,080
is interfaces

6156
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,640
right

6157
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,640
because IP

6158
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,500
address is not

6159
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,060
a host

6160
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:01,360
address

6161
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,240
it's an

6162
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:02,620
address of

6163
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,040
an interface

6164
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,940
you can have

6165
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:04,560
a device that

6166
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,140
have multiple

6167
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:05,820
IP addresses

6168
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,080
right

6169
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:07,860
you do in

6170
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:08,200
fact have

6171
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:08,740
devices with

6172
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:09,260
multiple IP

6173
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:09,560
addresses

6174
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,920
all your

6175
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,660
phones and

6176
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:13,320
laptops have

6177
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:13,980
multiple IP

6178
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:14,320
addresses

6179
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,420
but just

6180
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:18,140
simplifies things

6181
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:18,500
like this

6182
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,700
so it

6183
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,480
considers that

6184
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,400
you can

6185
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,020
essentially

6186
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,540
secure these

6187
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,740
routers and

6188
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:26,400
secure the

6189
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:26,820
hosts

6190
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:27,140
right

6191
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,560
but what you

6192
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,280
cannot secure

6193
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:29,980
fundamentally

6194
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,000
is these

6195
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,900
communication

6196
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:33,580
links

6197
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,960
so here

6198
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:35,600
from the

6199
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,120
host to

6200
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:36,240
the

6201
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:36,380
right

6202
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:36,620
and I

6203
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:36,960
imagine

6204
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,400
that this

6205
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:38,880
picture really

6206
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,300
shows you

6207
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:39,640
more like

6208
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,620
an organizational

6209
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,060
network

6210
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:41,380
right

6211
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,220
think about

6212
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,080
this is like

6213
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:43,520
UCI

6214
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,440
and this is

6215
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,160
UCLA

6216
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,220
and in

6217
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:48,840
between here

6218
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,400
it's only

6219
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,320
a short

6220
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,160
yellow line

6221
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:51,720
but this

6222
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:52,280
is in fact

6223
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,360
a potentially

6224
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,260
giant distance

6225
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:55,220
right

6226
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,020
many hops

6227
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:57,080
it is the

6228
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:57,440
internet

6229
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,100
in between

6230
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,380
so we don't

6231
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,240
trust anything

6232
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:00,600
that is

6233
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,360
between

6234
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,200
the boundary

6235
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:02,920
of UCI

6236
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,500
and UCLA

6237
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,520
but we also

6238
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,160
don't trust

6239
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,420
anything here

6240
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,340
within UCI

6241
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:08,220
because no

6242
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:09,180
we're using

6243
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,380
the ether

6244
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,300
and you know

6245
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:12,860
maybe we don't

6246
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:13,320
even trust

6247
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,280
OIT so much

6248
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,040
because they

6249
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:16,760
run all the

6250
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,380
wired infrastructure

6251
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,980
so that's the

6252
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:20,520
outlook from

6253
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,120
my BSEC

6254
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:21,660
point of view

6255
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,300
that we don't

6256
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,000
trust the

6257
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,360
wires

6258
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,320
and it

6259
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:27,720
comes in

6260
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:27,860
two

6261
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:28,240
well

6262
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,080
it comes in

6263
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:29,320
two

6264
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:29,860
what's called

6265
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,040
format flavors

6266
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:31,820
and two

6267
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:32,120
modes

6268
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:32,580
and this is

6269
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:33,040
confusing

6270
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:33,920
I already

6271
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,260
can warn you

6272
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,620
has two

6273
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:37,000
formats

6274
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,820
one is called

6275
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:38,560
ESP

6276
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,220
another is called

6277
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:39,680
AH

6278
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,260
that one is

6279
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:41,680
simpler

6280
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,460
authentication

6281
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:43,880
header

6282
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,320
and

6283
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,160
encapsulating

6284
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,000
security payload

6285
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,960
and they

6286
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:48,460
all work

6287
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:48,840
together

6288
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,300
with something

6289
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:49,880
we will not

6290
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:50,180
cover

6291
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:50,880
because it

6292
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:51,300
is just

6293
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,040
too damn

6294
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:52,400
boring

6295
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:52,780
and too

6296
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:53,220
difficult

6297
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:54,080
to cover

6298
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:54,420
in this

6299
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:54,680
kind of

6300
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:55,060
course

6301
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:55,980
called IP

6302
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:56,920
security policy

6303
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,320
and something

6304
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:57,600
called

6305
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:57,980
Ike

6306
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:58,680
internet key

6307
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:58,940
exchange

6308
01:14:58,940 --> 01:14:59,740
so unlike

6309
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:00,340
TLS

6310
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:02,040
I will not

6311
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:02,440
be telling

6312
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,120
you a lot

6313
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:03,740
about how

6314
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:04,060
keys

6315
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:04,660
are established

6316
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,740
because that's

6317
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:07,260
a separate

6318
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:07,680
thing

6319
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,560
in SSL

6320
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,020
CLS

6321
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:09,320
key

6322
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:09,720
establishment

6323
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,220
is like

6324
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:11,080
part and parcel

6325
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:11,500
of all the

6326
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:11,780
actual

6327
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:12,040
part

6328
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,820
okay

6329
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:14,840
cover is

6330
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:15,020
true

6331
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:15,300
right

6332
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,640
but in

6333
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,080
IPSEC

6334
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:17,480
it's not

6335
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,060
it's

6336
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:18,360
something

6337
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:18,900
it's like

6338
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:19,560
a separate

6339
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,160
component

6340
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:21,660
called

6341
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:22,020
Ike

6342
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:27,620
so what does

6343
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:28,300
IPSEC do

6344
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,180
only a couple

6345
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:29,680
more minutes

6346
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,340
and we're done

6347
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,080
it provides

6348
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,240
security in

6349
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:33,900
three cases

6350
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:34,800
but not only

6351
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,800
the main

6352
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,700
three use cases

6353
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,200
host to host

6354
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,040
meaning interface

6355
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:39,480
to source

6356
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,160
to destination

6357
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,120
okay

6358
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,620
end to end

6359
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,060
security

6360
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,080
it also

6361
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:45,740
provides

6362
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,780
host to gateway

6363
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:47,760
which means

6364
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,120
the typical

6365
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:49,840
scenario I want

6366
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,280
you to think

6367
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,240
about is that

6368
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:51,820
you work for a

6369
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:52,860
company and

6370
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,760
you have a host

6371
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,320
your laptop

6372
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,780
and you're in a

6373
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:56,420
hotel room

6374
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:57,400
in Slabonia

6375
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,140
okay

6376
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:01,240
some godforsaken

6377
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:01,620
place

6378
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:02,560
and you want

6379
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:02,900
to connect

6380
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:03,320
by the

6381
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:03,840
untrusted

6382
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,760
internet

6383
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,260
right

6384
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,560
over to

6385
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,080
the home

6386
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,140
office

6387
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,400
so your

6388
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:09,960
home office

6389
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:10,500
has a

6390
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,900
gateway

6391
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,400
a router

6392
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:12,700
right

6393
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,060
a gateway

6394
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:13,540
is basically

6395
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:13,960
a border

6396
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:14,260
router

6397
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:17,140
and so

6398
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,320
that whole

6399
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:18,740
wilderness

6400
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,360
between your

6401
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:19,720
laptop

6402
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,340
and that

6403
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:20,540
border

6404
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:20,860
router

6405
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,520
needs to

6406
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,060
be secured

6407
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:22,720
and that's

6408
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,260
what IPSEC

6409
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:23,520
will do

6410
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:23,800
for you

6411
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:23,980
too

6412
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:26,540
and then

6413
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:26,860
gateway

6414
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,360
to gateway

6415
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:27,900
that's more

6416
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:28,360
like thinking

6417
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:28,660
about

6418
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:29,100
again

6419
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,020
the UCI

6420
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:30,420
UCLA

6421
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:30,960
example

6422
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:31,600
on a

6423
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,160
previous slide

6424
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:36,420
that's more

6425
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:37,060
like how do

6426
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:37,520
we secure

6427
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,260
gateway

6428
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:38,900
to gateway

6429
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,060
right

6430
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:45,280
and you

6431
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:45,660
can also

6432
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:46,080
have

6433
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,760
all combinations

6434
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,180
there are

6435
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:48,700
like you can

6436
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:49,440
secure end

6437
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:49,860
to end

6438
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:50,440
and also

6439
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,520
on top of

6440
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:51,780
that

6441
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,220
gateway

6442
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:52,660
to gateway

6443
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,660
okay

6444
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:55,440
you can

6445
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,120
concatenate

6446
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:56,240
them

6447
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:56,500
you can

6448
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:56,760
have

6449
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,380
host to

6450
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:57,800
gateway

6451
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,700
IPSEC

6452
01:16:58,700 --> 01:16:59,940
then separate

6453
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:00,540
gateway to

6454
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:01,340
gateway IPSEC

6455
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:01,740
and another

6456
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:02,300
gateway to

6457
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,100
host IPSEC

6458
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,460
IPSEC is

6459
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,780
very malleable

6460
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:07,640
very flexible

6461
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:07,980
I guess

6462
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,500
right

6463
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,220
so

6464
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,520
typical

6465
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,200
and it has

6466
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:12,800
these also

6467
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,460
two modes

6468
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,180
which we

6469
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:14,500
don't have

6470
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,000
time to

6471
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:15,400
discuss

6472
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,260
called tunnel

6473
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,320
and transport

6474
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,440
I guess

6475
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,140
that means

6476
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:21,120
not a lot

6477
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,680
of IPSEC

6478
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,140
questions

6479
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:23,460
on your

6480
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:23,820
big jump

6481
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:24,180
sadly

6482
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:27,480
but you

6483
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:27,800
have time

6484
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,140
to read

6485
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:28,660
I will post

6486
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:28,940
this

6487
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,680
I just won't

6488
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,000
be asking

6489
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:31,620
very detailed

6490
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:32,020
questions

6491
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:34,000
alright

6492
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,360
good luck

6493
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:35,900
to y'all

6494
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,180
for next

6495
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:37,580
Tuesday

6496
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:40,520
please

6497
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,160
prepare

6498
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,260
I will

6499
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:43,720
have office

6500
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:44,200

Monday

6502
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,340
typically

6503
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:46,860
people want

6504
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:47,180
for some

6505
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:47,340
reason

6506
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:47,800
come and

6507
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,340
visit me

midterm

6510
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:49,520
on the

6511
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:49,800
final

6512
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,260
I don't

6513
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:50,420
know why

6514
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:50,840
that is

6515
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,500
yeah

6516
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,060
and

6517
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,320
be on

6518
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:55,580
time
