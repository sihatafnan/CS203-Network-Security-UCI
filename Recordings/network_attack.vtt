WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.980
which mail, as you'll know, has a mail from field, right, or all the emails that you receive have a from field, and that usually contains user ID, right, where is it coming from, and some domain name, that will result in the DNS lookup as well, and all kinds of spam checks and other ancillary encountered links will cause, even if bounce, like when an email bounces, even that requires that.

00:30.000 --> 01:00.000
DNS lookup. Also, we'll talk separately about phishing, but many anti-phishing defenses rely on DNS, right, so they try to resolve a particular name and see if it's a legitimate record or if it's something iffy, right, so that's a problem, and that's the, so spoofing phishing with DNS

01:00.000 --> 01:18.000
lookups, with poison DNS lookups, it's called farming, ph there, or phishing, from phishing. Let's see. There is also some nifty ways of what's called doing dynamic farming, which is essentially works like this. You provide

01:18.000 --> 01:47.980
a bogus, like a fake DNS mapping, or a trusted server, and trick a victim, a user, into downloading a malicious script from some attackers controlled evil server. And then the idea is that, what, what, what, what, what, what a phishers or attackers are generally after, they're after obtaining some sensitive information. So, the idea is that you download a malicious script from some evil attacker controlled

01:47.980 --> 02:17.980
server server, and then force the user to also download some restricted internal content. Think about not your home, think about working for a company, right, organization, where you have sensitive content hosted internally, okay? Like some maybe scripted salary lookups, or personnel record management, or some proprietary product designs, okay?

02:17.980 --> 02:24.980
So, if you have sensitive information, and so the idea, the attacker's goal is to get access to that sensitive information, right?

02:24.980 --> 02:46.980
So, if you manage to do that, right, and if you manage to fool JavaScript into, or the browser to realizing that, oh, the evil, the evil script, right, if you download it, and the sensitive content that that evil script tries to access,

02:46.980 --> 03:06.980
have the same origin, then access will be granted. Java, I mean, your browsers usually have this policy, I mean, all browsers have this policy called same origin policy, which means that, and that's why, for example, cookies tend to be, unless they are third party cookies, tend to be proprietary, right?

03:06.980 --> 03:28.980
The cookie from let's say, Microsoft cannot be read by cookie from IBM, right? So they are separate. And that has to do with that same, fundamental same origin policy, right? So if HTML, if a page comes from IBM, and it wants to access a Microsoft cookie, it cannot, because they have different origins.

03:28.980 --> 03:50.980
Okay? Because cookie by Microsoft was put there by MSN.com, or MS.com, or Microsoft.com, and cookie from IBM has an origin of IBM.com. Two different origins. But, if you have, let's say, WW, MSN, MS.com, it can access a cookie placed by MS.com, because the origin is the same.

03:50.980 --> 04:12.980
So that's the idea. So that's the idea. So let's consider an example. Okay, I'll give you an example. We have a web server, okay? And it sits at this address, intergood.net, okay, inside the organization, okay? And it has a private IP address.

04:12.980 --> 04:28.980
If everybody know this, okay, private IP addresses are different from public IP addresses, so it's like an internal network, a mail, and the address, let's say, is 10-0-0-7, and this server cannot be accessed from outside, okay?

04:28.980 --> 04:38.980
So if you try to connect from the outside, the firewall will not match, okay? And anyway, you cannot, there's no routing to that address, right?

04:38.980 --> 04:50.980
If you try to send a packet from the outside to 10-0-0-7, you'll get a destination and reach it even without firewall, because that's called a private IP address.

04:50.980 --> 04:56.980
And IP routing or internet routing does not route to such addresses.

04:56.980 --> 05:04.980
Okay, so this web server hosts, stores sensitive data and sensitive applications, okay?

05:04.980 --> 05:18.980
So what the attacker does is that the attacker sits at evil.org, gets a user who is an inside, Alice, to browse www.evil.org, okay?

05:18.980 --> 05:32.980
And you might think, well, how does he do that? But by now you should probably realize that there are many ways to do this with a, let's say, poison SMS message, iMessage, WhatsApp message, signal message, whatever.

05:32.980 --> 05:38.980
You can come on any messaging service, you can also come via email. Messaging is better because it's usually very quick, right?

05:38.980 --> 05:44.980
And if somebody falls for the phishing, they will do it very quickly, right?

05:44.980 --> 06:00.980
So the idea is that to get Alice to browse this, I mean, basically click on a link with www.evil.org, and the attackers placed a malicious JavaScript code on that evil.org, okay?

06:00.980 --> 06:13.980
And that code, right, as Alice enters www.evil.org, slash whatever, or slash nothing, and she automatically downloads, right, this JavaScript.

06:13.980 --> 06:22.980
Totally fine to download JavaScript. You can turn off JavaScript, but then a lot of websites won't work, right?

06:22.980 --> 06:39.980
So, okay, and so now this JavaScript says, okay, now I am inside, I can access something on this interhood.net, which is the internal server, like some CGI app or something like that.

06:39.980 --> 06:46.980
But it can't do that. It can't do that because that would be a violation of, say, origin policy, right?

06:46.980 --> 06:55.980
Because the origin of malicious JavaScript is exactly www, is actually evil.org.

06:55.980 --> 07:02.980
Evil.org, not equal to good.net, okay?

07:02.980 --> 07:08.980
Different origin, goodbye. So, no way.

07:08.980 --> 07:18.980
But, if the attacker also controls DNS, that becomes a real problem.

07:18.980 --> 07:23.980
So, here's the scenario. Go for it step by step.

07:23.980 --> 07:29.980
So, we have ZDAT 10.0.0.21, Alice's computer device.

07:29.980 --> 07:36.980
So, Alice has been tricked into looking up some way, right?

07:36.980 --> 07:39.980
www.evil.org.

07:39.980 --> 07:42.980
So, this goes to evil.org DNS.

07:42.980 --> 07:43.980
There's a DNS server, right?

07:43.980 --> 07:47.980
Authoritative DNS server that's set up by the adversary.

07:47.980 --> 07:51.980
And I'm showing you not all interactions.

07:51.980 --> 07:54.980
Actually, when you look up DNS, remember, you go to the root, right?

07:54.980 --> 08:02.980
And the root says, oh, it's going to the .org, and then .org says, oh, okay, here's the evil.org DNS server.

08:02.980 --> 08:03.980
Remember that?

08:03.980 --> 08:04.980
There's a multiple step.

08:04.980 --> 08:05.980
I'm omitting that.

08:05.980 --> 08:06.980
I'm just saying.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.980
I'm basically abstracting it away.

08:08.980 --> 08:16.980
So, eventually, good.net, the power goes to this evil.org DNS server, and gets back an address, a real address,

08:16.980 --> 08:23.980
an external address, 222334455, with a pretty short TTL, right?

08:23.980 --> 08:28.980
So, it's not going to sit in the cache for too long, right?

08:28.980 --> 08:32.980
And then, right, as she actually does a get, right?

08:32.980 --> 08:40.980
Because when you do a click on the URL, the first thing is the DNS looked up, and then you actually do an HTTP get.

08:40.980 --> 08:41.980
So, she gets something.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.980
I put the slash there, but whatever.

08:43.980 --> 08:44.980
It doesn't really matter.

08:44.980 --> 08:46.980
Some URL from there, okay?

08:46.980 --> 08:50.980
On this evil.org, and the response is a malicious JavaScript, right?

08:50.980 --> 08:54.980
Some kind of a page that contains a malicious JavaScript code.

08:54.980 --> 08:55.980
Okay?

08:55.980 --> 08:57.980
You're with me so far?

08:57.980 --> 08:58.980
Okay.

08:58.980 --> 09:00.980
That comes from an evil.org website.

09:00.980 --> 09:01.980
Okay?

09:01.980 --> 09:05.980
Not from the DNS server, from evil DNS server, but the evil.org actual website.

09:05.980 --> 09:09.980
And that's the correct, that 222 address is actually correct for that.

09:09.980 --> 09:16.980
Now, because that TTL expires very quickly, right?

09:16.980 --> 09:20.980
Some here, here, it expires, the TTL.

09:20.980 --> 09:28.980
So, the next time, or actually the next time, when as Alice loads the web page, okay?

09:28.980 --> 09:30.980
There can be some delay, right?

09:30.980 --> 09:31.980
That can be inserted there.

09:31.980 --> 09:40.980
And the JavaScript will again force a lookup of www.evil.org.

09:40.980 --> 09:45.980
Now, that will not be found in the cache because the TTL already expired, right?

09:45.980 --> 09:49.980
So, this record there that says 222, that's gone.

09:49.980 --> 09:50.980
It expired.

09:50.980 --> 09:52.980
That's why it's very short.

09:52.980 --> 09:53.980
It's a short TTL.

09:53.980 --> 10:00.980
And what's going to come back from evil.org DNS, this evil.org DNS, the same one as ever

10:00.980 --> 10:06.980
on top, is now a different address, 1007.

10:06.980 --> 10:11.980
See the trick?

10:11.980 --> 10:14.980
Very, very clever, right?

10:14.980 --> 10:22.980
And that 1007 points not to evil.org web, but points to an internal sensitive content server.

10:22.980 --> 10:29.980
That should only be accessed from the inside, by the insiders.

10:29.980 --> 10:30.980
Okay.

10:30.980 --> 10:33.980
Now, again, this is Alice, right?

10:33.980 --> 10:38.980
Alice's device, but it's executing malicious code, right?

10:38.980 --> 10:47.980
It says post CGI app, some kind of invoking some sensitive CGI app on the evil.org.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.980
But now evil.org is at 1007.

10:51.980 --> 10:52.980
Okay?

10:52.980 --> 11:00.980
So, the post command, the HTTP post command, goes through the intragut net.

11:00.980 --> 11:02.980
And the response is, that's it.

11:02.980 --> 11:04.980
That's the compromise, right?

11:04.980 --> 11:06.980
Now, this CGI is critical.

11:06.980 --> 11:08.980
What about database query?

11:08.980 --> 11:09.980
Okay?

11:09.980 --> 11:10.980
Whatever.

11:10.980 --> 11:11.980
It could be an embedded SQL query.

11:11.980 --> 11:12.980
Okay?

11:12.980 --> 11:16.980
It comes back here with the results, and it will be sent outside.

11:16.980 --> 11:17.980
Okay?

11:17.980 --> 11:20.980
I don't show you that.

11:20.980 --> 11:27.980
But the reason this attack works is because now the JavaScript, the same origin policy that

11:27.980 --> 11:39.980
it uses, is now satisfying, because the original, sorry, because the evil.org provided this address,

11:39.980 --> 11:45.980
and intergoodnet is associated with this address now.

11:45.980 --> 11:55.980
And therefore, the malicious JavaScript can access 1007 because they have the same origin.

11:55.980 --> 11:56.980
Okay?

11:56.980 --> 12:01.980
The origin is now evil.org, the same origin.

12:01.980 --> 12:07.980
So, the attack succeeds.

12:07.980 --> 12:12.980
Now, how do you solve this problem?

12:12.980 --> 12:18.980
If you know of the attack, and you wanted just a knee-jerk solution, you can say, well,

12:18.980 --> 12:21.980
the problem is due to the short TTL.

12:21.980 --> 12:24.980
Does that really help?

12:24.980 --> 12:30.980
I mean, it solves that attack problem, right?

12:30.980 --> 12:36.980
But what if the attacker just does it over and over?

12:36.980 --> 12:40.980
The same thing just until the attacker might know where the TTL is, right?

12:40.980 --> 12:49.980
Because the attacker can always, so the idea is that not accepting short TTLs, right?

12:49.980 --> 12:59.980
And sort of overriding them with long TTLs, long times, so that this entry with 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 does not expire.

12:59.980 --> 13:04.980
But eventually, it will, right?

13:04.980 --> 13:08.980
So, it's just sort of hedging the attack a little bit.

13:08.980 --> 13:12.980
It's not really solving the problem.

13:12.980 --> 13:18.980
One possibility is to randomize the client port.

13:18.980 --> 13:21.980
This is a general solution, right?

13:21.980 --> 13:28.980
So, you know, when the DNS servers, the DNS lives in a very specific reserved port.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.980
But remember, the clients pick a random port number.

13:31.980 --> 13:33.980
Well, they're supposed to.

13:33.980 --> 13:38.980
So, if you randomize the port number, instead of using always sort of the same,

13:38.980 --> 13:45.980
then that might help the attack, because the attacker has to guess that and transaction ID to reply.

13:45.980 --> 13:46.980
But this doesn't solve this problem.

13:46.980 --> 13:50.980
This solves other attacks we discussed in the last class.

13:50.980 --> 13:52.980
It doesn't solve this problem.

13:52.980 --> 14:01.980
The other possibility is to introduce some kind of a cryptographic or some more fundamental changes to DNS

14:01.980 --> 14:02.980
and add something.

14:02.980 --> 14:04.980
Kind of like with IP, there's IPsec.

14:04.980 --> 14:08.980
With HTTP, there is SSLTLS.

14:08.980 --> 14:17.980
So, there is something called DNSsec that can help with some of this.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.980
Okay, so what is DNSsec?

14:19.980 --> 14:25.980
Basically, it's extensions to the DNS operation and it works in two ways.

14:25.980 --> 14:30.980
There is the public key version and a secret key version.

14:30.980 --> 14:32.980
Or a symmetric key version, excuse me.

14:32.980 --> 14:39.980
And so the goal is to authenticate and check integrity of DNS requests.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.980
Okay, so the idea is that the client issues a query.

14:42.980 --> 14:47.980
Most of the problems occur not on the server side, right?

14:47.980 --> 14:48.980
It's on the client side.

14:48.980 --> 14:55.980
So the client receives a query, sorry, receives a query response that is not corresponding to what he asked.

14:55.980 --> 15:04.980
So, if you have a secure channel between the client and the DNS server, that should presumably solve the problem.

15:04.980 --> 15:05.980
Yes?

15:05.980 --> 15:14.980
Are we assuming the DNS server isn't doing the attack itself?

15:14.980 --> 15:15.980
Right.

15:15.980 --> 15:16.980
Right.

15:16.980 --> 15:17.980
Exactly.

15:17.980 --> 15:19.980
What is this solve?

15:19.980 --> 15:21.980
The DNS server.

15:21.980 --> 15:22.980
Right.

15:22.980 --> 15:23.980
So, remember.

15:23.980 --> 15:24.980
This.

15:24.980 --> 15:25.980
This attack.

15:25.980 --> 15:26.980
Right.

15:26.980 --> 15:27.980
This.

15:27.980 --> 15:28.980
Right.

15:28.980 --> 15:29.980
The race attack.

15:29.980 --> 15:33.980
The race to, or the attacker to guess the right transaction ID.

15:33.980 --> 15:34.980
Here, the randomizing the port number would help.

15:34.980 --> 15:35.980
Right.

15:35.980 --> 15:36.980
It would.

15:36.980 --> 15:40.980
Because if the attacker does not, because we see the attacker is not snooping on all this.

15:40.980 --> 15:41.980
Right.

15:41.980 --> 15:42.980
He's not there.

15:42.980 --> 15:43.980
He's outside.

15:43.980 --> 15:44.980
So, randomizing the port number will help because the attacker would not snooping on all this.

15:44.980 --> 15:45.980
Right.

15:45.980 --> 15:46.980
He's not there.

15:46.980 --> 15:47.980
He's outside.

15:47.980 --> 16:07.980
So, randomizing the port number will help because the attacker would not only have to guess the transaction ID, but would also have to guess the port number.

16:07.980 --> 16:18.980
And if you make it, you know, it's a 32-bit port number, then, sorry, 16-bit port number plus 16-bit transaction ID, that's guessing 32 bits less hard.

16:18.980 --> 16:19.980
Okay.

16:19.980 --> 16:20.980
Much harder.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.980
Much less likely the attacker will win.

16:23.980 --> 16:34.980
And the other problem the DNSSEC will solve is if the DNS server actually replies, it will reply with an authentic reply.

16:34.980 --> 16:41.980
Meaning it will actually secure the reply, right, and the attacker can no longer spoof it.

16:41.980 --> 16:47.980
Because eventually, you see, the DNS server does reply.

16:47.980 --> 16:52.980
And only, and if we use DNSSEC, only this reply will be authentic.

16:52.980 --> 16:57.980
So, all the other attempts to answer will be discarded because they're not authentic.

16:57.980 --> 16:58.980
Okay.

16:58.980 --> 16:59.980
So, how does DNSSEC work?

16:59.980 --> 17:00.980
Well, it's actually very simple, right?

17:00.980 --> 17:15.980
It just basically, you know, in a public key version, it just signs the record, right?

17:15.980 --> 17:18.980
So, remember, it replies with the record, right?

17:18.980 --> 17:33.980
Now, there is a bit of a debate whether you should sign it on the reply, meaning include the request in the reply, so that you can say this reply is exactly for this request.

17:33.980 --> 17:34.980
Okay?

17:34.980 --> 17:45.980
Or, you should pre-compute signed replies ahead of time, and that way save real-time computation.

17:45.980 --> 17:46.980
You follow me?

17:46.980 --> 17:48.980
Because DNS servers are busy, right?

17:48.980 --> 17:49.980
They're servers for a reason.

17:49.980 --> 17:52.980
They get a lot of queries.

17:52.980 --> 18:11.980
So, if you pre-compute signatures on popular DNS records, like for example, if a UCI has a DNS server and it pre-computes everything for like ICS-UCI-EDU or ENG-UCI-EDU, that would be smart, right?

18:11.980 --> 18:19.980
Because there will be a lot of queries for those, but it doesn't need to pre-compute answers to all DNS queries for all hosts, right?

18:19.980 --> 18:26.980
In the inside UCI, because there's just too many of them, and most of them aren't very, very popular in terms of people going to them.

18:26.980 --> 18:27.980
Okay?

18:27.980 --> 18:31.980
So, there is a trade-off there, which can be done in advance.

18:31.980 --> 18:38.980
The trade-off is that if you don't, if you pre-compute the signed, right?

18:38.980 --> 18:50.980
If you have public, or digitally signed replies, that means you cannot one-to-one associate the request with a reply, because multiple requests will result in the same reply.

18:50.980 --> 18:51.980
Okay?

18:51.980 --> 18:53.980
That raises some issues.

18:53.980 --> 18:55.980
Nothing super critical.

18:55.980 --> 18:56.980
You know?

18:56.980 --> 19:00.980
Now, the other problem is that, how do you distribute public keys?

19:00.980 --> 19:03.980
That's basically the fundamental public key distribution problem, right?

19:03.980 --> 19:09.980
So, the PKDNS assumes that the DNS servers have a public key hierarchy.

19:09.980 --> 19:10.980
PKI.

19:10.980 --> 19:12.980
Remember we talked about this earlier on?

19:12.980 --> 19:17.980
But that's actually not difficult, because the DNS itself is a hierarchy.

19:17.980 --> 19:18.980
Right?

19:18.980 --> 19:26.980
With all these roots, and then secondlevel.com.edu.org, and then all the others underneath.

19:26.980 --> 19:29.980
So, establishing a hierarchy is actually pretty natural.

19:29.980 --> 19:44.980
There is a minor mid-weight version called DNSSEC symmetric key, and basically there it's faster, but it assumes here that there are these pre-established secure channels.

19:44.980 --> 19:45.980
Okay?

19:45.980 --> 19:50.980
Between parent-child DNS servers.

19:50.980 --> 19:56.980
And there's also a secure channel between the client and the first level DNS responder.

19:56.980 --> 20:07.980
Now, there's also something called DNS over HTTP, network of HTTPS, it's called D-O-H, which essentially makes DNS clear to go over TLS SSL.

20:07.980 --> 20:15.980
And if you dig into your browser, or your network setting, you might be able to find an option for that.

20:15.980 --> 20:20.980
It's probably unclear, but you can force your browser to always use that.

20:20.980 --> 20:26.980
But the idea is basically that all the messages are encrypted and mapped.

20:26.980 --> 20:29.980
And mapped is the integrity message authentication code.

20:29.980 --> 20:35.980
So, the encryption in the MAC are done with different keys, kind of like in itself derived from the same master key.

20:35.980 --> 20:41.980
And yeah, and each message has a nonce, so there's no replaying, etc.

20:41.980 --> 20:47.980
And the idea is that each DNS must share a symmetric master key with its family.

20:47.980 --> 20:52.980
If you want to know more about it, here's an in-depth presentation.

20:52.980 --> 20:54.980
Any questions about DNS?

20:54.980 --> 21:06.980
I did not tell you about all possible attacks, because just DNS security by itself is probably like a half a quarter, five week course in and of itself.

21:06.980 --> 21:12.980
This is, again, like everything in this course, kind of an appetizer.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.980
No rushes?

21:15.980 --> 21:16.980
Okay.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.980
Well, that is the end of the net attacks.

21:19.980 --> 21:38.980
Now we skip something completely different.

21:38.980 --> 21:42.980
Now I'm going to talk about privacy in a minute.

21:42.980 --> 21:47.980
So, you probably know a bit about this already.

21:47.980 --> 21:52.980
It's hard to actually be an internet user and not know about it.

21:52.980 --> 22:00.980
And unless you live in a vacuum, you definitely hear all the time about attacks and leaks and threats.

22:00.980 --> 22:06.980
So, privacy is kind of a long-standing problem or a long-standing concept.

22:06.980 --> 22:12.980
By itself, privacy and anonymity have nothing to do with the digital world.

22:12.980 --> 22:14.980
I mean, they exist in the analog world.

22:14.980 --> 22:17.980
We all know what privacy means in the analog world.

22:17.980 --> 22:20.980
Most of you should know what anonymity means, right?

22:20.980 --> 22:27.980
Does anybody want to say what anonymity means in the physical world?

22:27.980 --> 22:30.980
Any guesses?

22:30.980 --> 22:33.980
You know the word, right?

22:33.980 --> 22:36.980
What does that actually mean?

22:36.980 --> 22:39.980
There's no wrong answer.

22:39.980 --> 22:42.980
I'm not going to be judged.

22:42.980 --> 22:44.980
Not identifiable.

22:44.980 --> 22:45.980
Okay.

22:45.980 --> 22:47.980
Not identifiable what?

22:47.980 --> 22:50.980
Give me an example.

22:50.980 --> 22:52.980
Maybe an example you have in mind.

22:52.980 --> 22:53.980
On the physical world.

22:53.980 --> 22:54.980
What is anonymity?

22:54.980 --> 23:11.980
Well, there's a disturbance, some kind of a going on.

23:11.980 --> 23:14.980
And maybe you've heard of like antifa protesters, right?

23:14.980 --> 23:18.980
Or whenever there are protests on campus.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.980
Let's say, like the one we had last year.

23:20.980 --> 23:21.980
I don't remember if we had masks.

23:21.980 --> 23:24.980
But in many of those protests, people wear masks.

23:24.980 --> 23:25.980
Right?

23:25.980 --> 23:27.980
Why do they wear masks?

23:27.980 --> 23:31.980
To be anonymous.

23:31.980 --> 23:33.980
We know they're there.

23:33.980 --> 23:34.980
They're people, right?

23:34.980 --> 23:36.980
They're people.

23:36.980 --> 23:40.980
Well, at least maybe for now, about years from now, they might be robots.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.980
But today, we know they're people.

23:43.980 --> 23:44.980
They're humans.

23:44.980 --> 23:47.980
We might even be able to tell the gender.

23:47.980 --> 23:49.980
Not always.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.980
Height, maybe.

23:51.980 --> 23:53.980
Weight, sort of.

23:53.980 --> 23:56.980
But most identifying features are hidden, right?

23:56.980 --> 23:57.980
When you wear a mask.

23:57.980 --> 24:01.980
Put on a mask, a hat, pair of sunglasses.

24:01.980 --> 24:04.980
Nobody can tell your eye color, your hair color.

24:04.980 --> 24:05.980
Right?

24:05.980 --> 24:06.980
The typical identification.

24:06.980 --> 24:09.980
Oh, facial recognition doesn't work, right?

24:09.980 --> 24:10.980
Be careful.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.980
Not with a COVID mask.

24:12.980 --> 24:14.980
With a COVID mask, it still works.

24:14.980 --> 24:19.980
But a real, like a balaclava type mask won't work.

24:19.980 --> 24:20.980
Right?

24:20.980 --> 24:22.980
That's anonymity.

24:22.980 --> 24:28.980
When a bandit, you know, western style bandits will put a bandana on their face to rob a bank

24:28.980 --> 24:31.980
or a stagecoach, like you've seen in some movies.

24:31.980 --> 24:32.980
That's essentially what they want.

24:32.980 --> 24:33.980
An anonymity.

24:33.980 --> 24:34.980
Right?

24:34.980 --> 24:36.980
It's not a question where they're robbers.

24:36.980 --> 24:37.980
Right?

24:37.980 --> 24:38.980
They're oil robbers.

24:38.980 --> 24:40.980
You know how many there are.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.980
But you don't know what they are, who they are.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.980
That's anonymity.

24:45.980 --> 24:54.980
If you are worried about privacy, and let's say you want to buy, I don't know, some, let's

24:54.980 --> 24:57.980
say you are a crypto smoker.

24:57.980 --> 24:58.980
You are a crypto smoker.

24:58.980 --> 24:59.980
You don't smoke crypto.

24:59.980 --> 25:00.980
I don't mean that.

25:00.980 --> 25:01.980
No, crypto means hidden.

25:01.980 --> 25:04.980
You're like, you don't want anybody to know who to smoke.

25:04.980 --> 25:05.980
Okay?

25:05.980 --> 25:12.980
So, you don't want the transaction to show up on your credit card, for example.

25:12.980 --> 25:15.980
In fact, you bought cigarettes at 7-Eleven.

25:15.980 --> 25:18.980
Or that you ordered them on the web, right?

25:18.980 --> 25:20.980
So, what do you do in the physical world?

25:20.980 --> 25:21.980
Well, you could.

25:21.980 --> 25:22.980
You probably will not end well.

25:22.980 --> 25:29.980
But you could put a paper bag over your head with a couple of holes for eyes.

25:29.980 --> 25:34.980
Get some cash from the ATM somewhere else well before.

25:34.980 --> 25:35.980
Walk in.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.980
Say, don't worry, I'm not here to rob you.

25:37.980 --> 25:41.980
I would like a pack of Marlboros.

25:41.980 --> 25:42.980
Okay?

25:42.980 --> 25:48.980
If the clerk is not scared of trickless, they will take your cash, give you a pack of Marlboros,

25:48.980 --> 25:50.980
and off you go.

25:50.980 --> 25:53.980
That's an anonymous transaction.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.980
Cash is anonymous, right?

25:55.980 --> 25:57.980
You are anonymous.

25:57.980 --> 26:00.980
You could be wearing stilts to disguise your height.

26:00.980 --> 26:06.980
You could be wearing, I don't know, you could bend your knees if you're wearing something

26:06.980 --> 26:07.980
to disguise your height.

26:07.980 --> 26:09.980
You could make yourself shorter.

26:09.980 --> 26:11.980
You know, you could alter your voice.

26:11.980 --> 26:15.980
And with a paper bag over your head, you're anonymous.

26:15.980 --> 26:16.980
I know, it's silly.

26:16.980 --> 26:19.980
But that's the idea of physical anonymity.

26:19.980 --> 26:20.980
Okay?

26:20.980 --> 26:27.980
The fact that someone bought cigarettes at that 7-Eleven is not disguised.

26:27.980 --> 26:29.980
The question is, who bought cigarettes?

26:29.980 --> 26:31.980
Well, somebody did.

26:31.980 --> 26:35.980
But that somebody is indistinguishable from anybody outside, right?

26:35.980 --> 26:37.980
Any number of people.

26:37.980 --> 26:38.980
That's an anonymity.

26:38.980 --> 26:42.980
And that's basically what an anonymity is in the digital world.

26:42.980 --> 26:43.980
You'll see it.

26:43.980 --> 26:45.980
But it's not the same thing for privacy.

26:45.980 --> 26:50.980
Privacy is kind of, in the physical world, is the right to be left alone.

26:50.980 --> 26:51.980
Okay?

26:51.980 --> 26:57.980
So, there is a bit of a disconnect between the definition of privacy, the way that lawyers

26:57.980 --> 27:02.980
define it in the physical world, and the way we see it on the internet.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.980
And it's difficult to define.

27:04.980 --> 27:09.980
So, I won't try to give you an overall definition of privacy.

27:09.980 --> 27:17.980
But it is something that most people in the world, not everywhere, believe is like an individual

27:17.980 --> 27:20.980
right and natural desire to have privacy.

27:20.980 --> 27:21.980
I mean, right?

27:21.980 --> 27:26.980
I mean, we have, I don't know, changing rooms for privacy, right?

27:26.980 --> 27:30.980
We have bathrooms for, stalls for privacy, right?

27:30.980 --> 27:35.980
We have tentative classrooms, you know, in some places for privacy.

27:35.980 --> 27:39.980
I mean, lots of things we do in the real world are for privacy.

27:39.980 --> 27:46.980
Now, privacy is relevant not just to individuals, right?

27:46.980 --> 27:49.980
So far, everything I said is about individual privacy.

27:49.980 --> 27:55.980
But it's also relevant to other entities like governments and groups and corporations.

27:55.980 --> 27:58.980
And maybe it's obvious why.

27:58.980 --> 27:59.980
Maybe not.

27:59.980 --> 28:00.980
We'll see.

28:00.980 --> 28:07.980
So, as the time goes by and sort of the internet is permeating everyday life for more and more

28:07.980 --> 28:13.980
people, there's definitely globally an increase in awareness of privacy.

28:13.980 --> 28:18.980
Although most people, if you ask them to define it, well, kind of like you guys, you can't

28:18.980 --> 28:21.980
define really or not sure you can't, right?

28:21.980 --> 28:24.980
Give me a good definition of privacy.

28:24.980 --> 28:25.980
I can't hide it.

28:25.980 --> 28:27.980
But there is awareness of it.

28:27.980 --> 28:28.980
Privacy is important.

28:28.980 --> 28:33.980
But if you ask people, and some researchers did surveys, opinions are all over the map

28:33.980 --> 28:36.980
like what it means, what privacy means.

28:36.980 --> 28:37.980
Okay?

28:37.980 --> 28:41.980
It's also highly cultural and etc.

28:41.980 --> 28:45.980
And so, I say it's both nebulous and fickle.

28:45.980 --> 28:48.980
Nebulous means it's kind of, well, difficult to define.

28:48.980 --> 28:50.980
Fickle means it changes.

28:50.980 --> 28:54.980
A lot of times people will say, well, you know, my privacy is important.

28:54.980 --> 28:57.980
Like, if you give an example, what if this happens to you?

28:57.980 --> 28:58.980
Do you become certain?

28:58.980 --> 28:59.980
Yes.

28:59.980 --> 29:01.980
What if it happens to somewhere else?

29:01.980 --> 29:02.980
No.

29:02.980 --> 29:05.980
So, privacy is a very personal thing.

29:05.980 --> 29:11.980
We also live in a society that because of social networking, and this is the last 20

29:11.980 --> 29:13.980
years, I think, right?

29:13.980 --> 29:17.980
The beginning of social networking, about 20 years ago.

29:17.980 --> 29:24.980
The whole idea of social networking promotes, among other things, good and bad, it promotes

29:24.980 --> 29:26.980
lawyerism and exhibitionism.

29:26.980 --> 29:30.980
If you don't know what those terms are, or do you?

29:30.980 --> 29:31.980
Exhibitionism is just like, look at me.

29:31.980 --> 29:32.980
I'm interesting.

29:32.980 --> 29:33.980
Yes.

29:33.980 --> 29:34.980
I bought a purse.

29:34.980 --> 29:35.980
I bought a new bike.

29:35.980 --> 29:36.980
Look at me.

29:36.980 --> 29:37.980
I'm on a vacation in Krakistan.

29:37.980 --> 29:38.980
Look at me.

29:38.980 --> 29:39.980
Next to the, you know, the Tower of Pisa.

29:39.980 --> 29:40.980
Look at me in the Grand Canyon.

29:40.980 --> 29:41.980
I'm so interested.

29:41.980 --> 29:56.980
I'm not like those other 10,000 grad students who went on a Grand Canyon vacation as soon

29:56.980 --> 29:57.980
as I got here.

29:57.980 --> 29:58.980
So, this is the exhibitionism.

29:58.980 --> 29:59.980
Voyeurism is the opposite.

29:59.980 --> 30:02.980
The people who are actually looking at stuff because they have nothing better to do.

30:02.980 --> 30:05.980
And, you know, in the extreme, do cyber stalking.

30:05.980 --> 30:06.980
That's lawyers.

30:06.980 --> 30:10.980
Anyway, so social networking, for better or for worse, promotes these kinds of things.

30:10.980 --> 30:14.980
And, that's clearly not a good thing for privacy.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.980
And, even worse, for anonymity, right?

30:16.980 --> 30:23.980
So, how can you demand privacy if you post your pictures, you know, five times a day?

30:23.980 --> 30:24.980
With geolocation.

30:24.980 --> 30:34.980
Anyway, the amount of information, not just social networking type information.

30:34.980 --> 30:38.980
The amount of information essentially disclosed on the internet, on the public internet, has

30:38.980 --> 30:41.980
grown tremendously in the last 20 years.

30:41.980 --> 30:42.980
Right?

30:42.980 --> 30:45.980
Much more handling and transfer of sensing information occurs.

30:45.980 --> 30:51.980
And, this is not, again, your own photos and blogs, vlogs and whatever else, right?

30:51.980 --> 30:55.980
We're talking about sensitive medical information.

30:55.980 --> 31:03.980
All kinds of records, official records, driver's licenses, marriages, divorces, lawsuits.

31:03.980 --> 31:06.980
Everything is out there on the internet, right?

31:06.980 --> 31:11.980
Whereas, 20 years ago, you would probably have a hard time finding a lot of this information.

31:11.980 --> 31:16.980
Anyway, you would have, it was available, mind you, but you would have to actually physically

31:16.980 --> 31:18.980
search for it.

31:18.980 --> 31:25.980
And, unfortunately, as a result of all this, there's much less privacy and accountability.

31:25.980 --> 31:30.980
Now, we all recall that the internet was designed as a public good, right?

31:30.980 --> 31:32.980
As a public resource.

31:32.980 --> 31:37.980
So, complaining about lack of privacy on the internet is a bit silly, in a way.

31:37.980 --> 31:38.980
Right?

31:38.980 --> 31:45.980
We know that from the discussions about IP, TCP, et cetera, that most information on the internet

31:45.980 --> 31:48.980
is, well, a lot of information is public, by default.

31:48.980 --> 31:49.980
Right?

31:49.980 --> 31:59.980
So, an IP packet that you could snoop on easily, right, is possible to hide information in it.

31:59.980 --> 32:05.980
If you use SSLTLS, everything will be hidden from after the transport layer header.

32:05.980 --> 32:10.980
If you use IPsec, everything after the IP header will be hidden.

32:10.980 --> 32:18.980
But, at the very least, because routing needs to happen on the public internet, the outermost IP headers are visible, aren't they?

32:18.980 --> 32:19.980
Always.

32:19.980 --> 32:20.980
Always, right?

32:20.980 --> 32:21.980
A definition.

32:21.980 --> 32:24.980
You have to route packets on the internet.

32:24.980 --> 32:28.980
And, in the network layer, that means that there has to be an IP layer present.

32:28.980 --> 32:32.980
Otherwise, that could get discarded or not even sent.

32:32.980 --> 32:35.980
And recall what's in the IP header.

32:35.980 --> 32:40.980
Well, among other things, in the IP header, there's source, destination, and the protocol.

32:40.980 --> 32:45.980
The protocol says which is the transport layer protocol to use now.

32:45.980 --> 32:50.980
Now, if you don't use IPsec, there's a lot more, right?

32:50.980 --> 32:58.980
But, even if you use IPsec, the outermost header, at the very least, tells you the IP addresses of IPsec gateways.

32:58.980 --> 32:59.980
Right?

32:59.980 --> 33:01.980
Remember these IPsecs?

33:01.980 --> 33:04.980
You can build tunnels, right?

33:04.980 --> 33:07.980
So, even if you hide the end posts, right?

33:07.980 --> 33:16.980
You have an organization on, say, two campuses of the same organization on different places on the internet.

33:16.980 --> 33:20.980
Alice is in one campus talking to B in another campus.

33:20.980 --> 33:21.980
That's fine.

33:21.980 --> 33:25.980
Nobody in the middle of the internet can see that Alice is talking to Bob.

33:25.980 --> 33:30.980
But, everybody can see that Campus 1 is talking to Campus 2.

33:30.980 --> 33:31.980
Right?

33:31.980 --> 33:34.980
Someone on this campus is talking to someone on this campus.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.980
Because the addresses of the IP gateways, right?

33:37.980 --> 33:40.980
The border gateways will tell you.

33:40.980 --> 33:45.980
You might not think that's a lot of information, but it is.

33:45.980 --> 33:48.980
Also, the frequency of packets.

33:48.980 --> 33:49.980
Right?

33:49.980 --> 33:51.980
The timing of packets is important.

33:51.980 --> 33:53.980
It leaks information.

33:53.980 --> 33:54.980
Okay?

33:54.980 --> 34:01.980
For example, if you have, let's say you have the following situation.

34:01.980 --> 34:04.980
You have a transit autonomous system.

34:04.980 --> 34:05.980
Right?

34:05.980 --> 34:07.980
Remember we talked about autonomous systems.

34:07.980 --> 34:09.980
And there's a transit provider, right?

34:09.980 --> 34:10.980
Provides transit service.

34:10.980 --> 34:12.980
And it serves two companies.

34:12.980 --> 34:15.980
Now we talk about two companies, not two campuses at the same.

34:15.980 --> 34:17.980
Two companies in AFD.

34:17.980 --> 34:26.980
Normally, the transit service provider does not observe much traffic between AFD.

34:26.980 --> 34:27.980
Okay?

34:27.980 --> 34:30.980
It does not.

34:30.980 --> 34:33.980
All of a sudden, there is a spike in IPsec traffic.

34:33.980 --> 34:36.980
Now what could it be?

34:36.980 --> 34:42.980
AFD are companies that are registered, so you can look up what they are in the real world.

34:42.980 --> 34:46.980
Let's say one of them is a pharmaceutical company.

34:46.980 --> 34:51.980
Another one is a pharmaceutical startup.

34:51.980 --> 34:52.980
Okay?

34:52.980 --> 35:00.980
What could you possibly conclude when the traffic spikes between a large pharmaceutical company

35:00.980 --> 35:05.980
and a pharmaceutical startup?

35:05.980 --> 35:07.980
Probably.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.980
Probably something is going on between these.

35:10.980 --> 35:14.980
One is going to probably swallow the other.

35:14.980 --> 35:17.980
That's privileged information.

35:17.980 --> 35:20.980
That's kind of insider information.

35:20.980 --> 35:21.980
Why?

35:21.980 --> 35:23.980
You don't know what the hell they are talking about.

35:23.980 --> 35:25.980
But you know when.

35:25.980 --> 35:26.980
Huh?

35:26.980 --> 35:27.980
You know when.

35:27.980 --> 35:29.980
And you know how much a person will do.

35:29.980 --> 35:35.980
Now they could always pretend to send more traffic than they actually have to send, right?

35:35.980 --> 35:36.980
By just sending garbage.

35:36.980 --> 35:40.980
But they cannot send less.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.980
And obscuring timing.

35:42.980 --> 35:44.980
How do they obscure timing?

35:44.980 --> 35:46.980
If the negotiations happen in the middle of the night.

35:46.980 --> 35:47.980
Ah.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.980
That might also be an interesting thing.

35:49.980 --> 35:50.980
Okay?

35:50.980 --> 35:51.980
It's urgent.

35:51.980 --> 35:53.980
Then it's time to invest.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.980
Or buy some shares of that smaller startup.

35:55.980 --> 35:56.980
Or of the bigger one.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.980
And you can make some money.

35:58.980 --> 35:59.980
While others won't.

35:59.980 --> 36:00.980
Do you see that?

36:00.980 --> 36:02.980
Where I'm going with this.

36:02.980 --> 36:03.980
Okay?

36:03.980 --> 36:06.980
Or all of a sudden you have the US government.

36:06.980 --> 36:07.980
Department of State.

36:07.980 --> 36:08.980
Okay?

36:08.980 --> 36:12.980
That never sends much traffic to its embassy in Zimbabwe.

36:12.980 --> 36:22.980
And all of a sudden you notice as a transit provider that there's like a giant spider.

36:22.980 --> 36:23.980
What's going on?

36:23.980 --> 36:24.980
Huh?

36:24.980 --> 36:29.980
Maybe there's a coup in Zimbabwe.

36:29.980 --> 36:30.980
Happens.

36:30.980 --> 36:35.980
Maybe there's a military action that is being planned.

36:35.980 --> 36:37.980
That's information.

36:37.980 --> 36:38.980
Right?

36:38.980 --> 36:41.980
So that's valuable information.

36:41.980 --> 36:42.980
Anyway.

36:42.980 --> 36:43.980
As I said before.

36:43.980 --> 36:46.980
Encryption doesn't solve this problem.

36:46.980 --> 36:47.980
Right?

36:47.980 --> 36:56.980
Encryption is not enough for anonymity or even real privacy.

36:56.980 --> 37:01.980
What are applications of anonymity?

37:01.980 --> 37:03.980
Well.

37:03.980 --> 37:06.980
Hiding transactions.

37:06.980 --> 37:07.980
Hiding transactions.

37:07.980 --> 37:08.980
You know.

37:08.980 --> 37:12.980
If we had, for example, electronic cash.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.980
Anybody ever heard of electronic cash?

37:14.980 --> 37:15.980
It exists.

37:15.980 --> 37:16.980
It's a concept.

37:16.980 --> 37:21.980
If you took an advanced crypto class you may have heard of electronic cash.

37:21.980 --> 37:28.980
But I used to give a lecture on it like 10, 12 years ago but now it's becoming obsolete.

37:28.980 --> 37:34.980
But electronic cash is essentially the idea is to replicate physical cash in electronic

37:34.980 --> 37:35.980
form.

37:35.980 --> 37:38.980
And by the way, cryptocurrencies are not, are not cash.

37:38.980 --> 37:39.980
You know that right?

37:39.980 --> 37:40.980
Why not?

37:40.980 --> 37:41.980
Why not?

37:41.980 --> 37:51.980
Because cryptocurrencies have wallets and have owners and so there's no truly anonymous

37:51.980 --> 37:52.980
cryptocurrency.

37:52.980 --> 37:56.980
What cryptocurrencies give you is what's called pseudonymity.

37:56.980 --> 37:57.980
Like when you, yeah.

37:57.980 --> 37:58.980
But there's cold wallets.

37:58.980 --> 37:59.980
They can just give you this crypto.

37:59.980 --> 38:00.980
Yes.

38:00.980 --> 38:01.980
But the wallet is a wallet.

38:01.980 --> 38:12.980
You cannot transform one wallet magically into another wallet that is not linkable.

38:12.980 --> 38:14.980
You see, you get a wallet, it stays a wallet.

38:14.980 --> 38:17.980
So, now I don't know who's behind it.

38:17.980 --> 38:20.980
I don't know it's you or him or anybody else.

38:20.980 --> 38:25.980
What I do know is what it receives and what it sends, right?

38:25.980 --> 38:30.980
Like most cryptocurrencies, I don't claim to know a lot about cryptocurrencies, okay?

38:30.980 --> 38:37.980
But most of them will function on this premise of like wallets where you accumulate a specific

38:37.980 --> 38:38.980
cryptocurrency.

38:38.980 --> 38:44.980
If you are, but if you go with like a big provider like Coinbase or something like that,

38:44.980 --> 38:47.980
they aggregate those wallets for you, okay?

38:47.980 --> 38:54.980
But if you're an individual in a cryptocurrency trader or investor, you have typically this

38:54.980 --> 38:55.980
number of wallets.

38:55.980 --> 39:00.980
You have a Bitcoin wallet, an Ethereum wallet, and they all have addresses.

39:00.980 --> 39:08.980
Now, the link between an address and a human being, that's something that, you know, not

39:08.980 --> 39:09.980
given, right?

39:09.980 --> 39:12.980
It's difficult to establish who that is.

39:12.980 --> 39:19.980
But what wallets have this form, the term is persistent identifiers, that wallet ID,

39:19.980 --> 39:22.980
which is like some kind of binary string, right?

39:22.980 --> 39:24.980
And they're unique.

39:24.980 --> 39:28.980
And because of that, there is no actual anonymity because you can link all the transactions to

39:28.980 --> 39:29.980
that wallet.

39:29.980 --> 39:31.980
You know exactly what that wallet is doing.

39:31.980 --> 39:34.980
Sending so much money, receiving so much money.

39:34.980 --> 39:41.980
You know, one of the problems, we haven't talked about ransomware, but when an organization

39:41.980 --> 39:47.980
gets hit by ransomware and they pay the ransom, it's very clear to whom they're paying.

39:47.980 --> 39:49.980
A specific wallet, right?

39:49.980 --> 39:55.980
Because ransomware loves, the attackers, ransomware attackers, they love Bitcoin and other types

39:55.980 --> 39:56.980
of cryptocurrencies.

39:56.980 --> 39:59.980
And they give you an ID, usually.

39:59.980 --> 40:05.980
If you've seen like a ransom message that follows, usually follows the ransomware attack,

40:05.980 --> 40:08.980
it says, transfer money here.

40:08.980 --> 40:12.980
And they give you the explicit ID.

40:12.980 --> 40:14.980
But you don't know who that is.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.980
It's very hard to find out who.

40:16.980 --> 40:19.980
But it's still not anonymity.

40:19.980 --> 40:28.980
Anyway, so online payment, sometimes you want to browse anonymously, right?

40:28.980 --> 40:33.980
You know, in graduate school people do research.

40:33.980 --> 40:39.980
Sometimes research requires looking at sites that are not pleasant.

40:39.980 --> 40:40.980
Okay?

40:40.980 --> 40:45.980
For example, in my group some years ago, we had to go to some particular porn site.

40:45.980 --> 40:46.980
Okay.

40:46.980 --> 40:47.980
Why?

40:47.980 --> 40:50.980
Because we were studying CAPTCHAs.

40:50.980 --> 40:55.980
And that porn site, the way it worked, it was free.

40:55.980 --> 40:58.980
But to get access to it, you had to solve a CAPTCHA.

40:58.980 --> 41:05.980
But really cleverly, what it was doing, it was specifically making the users of that porn

41:05.980 --> 41:10.980
site function as human CAPTCHA solvers for a bot.

41:10.980 --> 41:13.980
Maybe that doesn't make sense here.

41:13.980 --> 41:20.980
So, there was a bot operator, okay, that was creating Facebook and Gmail accounts, okay?

41:20.980 --> 41:23.980
And Instagram accounts.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.980
Now, normally these bots, what they do is they automate, right?

41:26.980 --> 41:31.980
Create an account, provide a password, select a user ID, fill in the password, etc.

41:31.980 --> 41:38.980
But then, all these Instagram, Facebook, Google, they have CAPTCHAs, right?

41:38.980 --> 41:41.980
They say, prove you're a human before we create an account.

41:41.980 --> 41:44.980
You see what I'm saying?

41:44.980 --> 41:47.980
But the bot that operated is not human.

41:47.980 --> 41:53.980
So, what they were doing is that they made a partnership with a porn site, where every

41:53.980 --> 41:59.980
time, when they wanted to create an account, and a CAPTCHA popped out, they sent this CAPTCHA

41:59.980 --> 42:01.980
to the porn site, okay?

42:01.980 --> 42:04.980
That presented that CAPTCHA to the next user.

42:04.980 --> 42:08.980
And so, with a high enough volume of traffic, there was always somebody trying to get access

42:08.980 --> 42:09.980
to the porn site.

42:09.980 --> 42:14.980
They would pop up with a CAPTCHA, the user would solve it quickly, the solution would

42:14.980 --> 42:20.980
come back to the bot, and it would feed it into Gmail, Instagram, Facebook, okay?

42:20.980 --> 42:23.980
So, long story short, let's come back.

42:23.980 --> 42:28.980
Yes, so we had to look at that particular porn site a couple of times, you know, so, you

42:28.980 --> 42:33.980
don't want to do it from university computers, right?

42:33.980 --> 42:38.980
So, you do use anonymous browsing, okay?

42:38.980 --> 42:43.980
That essentially hides your browsing patterns.

42:43.980 --> 42:50.980
So, if you're using standard browsers, what you're browsing is not private, generally.

42:50.980 --> 42:53.980
I mean, some of them are more private than others.

42:53.980 --> 42:58.980
I mean, yes, Safari is better than Firefox, and nothing is worse than even the Explorer,

42:58.980 --> 43:03.980
but then there is DuckDuckGo, and Brave, and they all pretend to be very private, et cetera,

43:03.980 --> 43:05.980
but they're actually not very private.

43:05.980 --> 43:08.980
If you want private, you use the Tor browser, okay?

43:08.980 --> 43:10.980
I will talk about Tor in a second.

43:10.980 --> 43:19.980
Okay, so web browsing, you want to look up a site, even something innocuous, like you

43:19.980 --> 43:22.980
totally, like you want to price out a certain item, right?

43:22.980 --> 43:26.980
You're looking for, I don't know, a refrigerator, or a pair of shoes.

43:26.980 --> 43:28.980
You don't want to get ads, okay?

43:28.980 --> 43:34.980
You don't want to pollute yourself with all this information that will incessantly pop

43:34.980 --> 43:37.980
out ads about shoes or refrigerators.

43:37.980 --> 43:40.980
So, anonymous browsing is good for that.

43:40.980 --> 43:42.980
You want to use a search engine, too.

43:42.980 --> 43:49.980
You don't want a search engine, like Gmail, or Google, or Bing, or whatever, to know your

43:49.980 --> 43:50.980
search patterns.

43:50.980 --> 43:56.980
Sometimes you want to send an untraceable message, an untraceable email, because maybe

43:56.980 --> 44:01.980
you are a whistleblower, corporate or government whistleblower, and you would like to report

44:01.980 --> 44:05.980
something criminal or some abuse anonymously.

44:05.980 --> 44:11.980
Well, hell, even here at UCI, we have a way to do so, by the way.

44:11.980 --> 44:17.980
We also, I mean, we have it in the physical world, there's an Office of the Ombudsman to

44:17.980 --> 44:19.980
which you can report things anonymously.

44:19.980 --> 44:24.980
But we also, last time I checked, a couple years ago, there was a way to anonymously send

44:24.980 --> 44:26.980
email, except it's not truly anonymous.

44:26.980 --> 44:33.980
I mean, there's a way to basically use a web form, okay, to send an anonymously.

44:33.980 --> 44:43.980
If you're a dissident, a political dissident in an oppressive society, maybe this is socially

44:43.980 --> 44:46.980
sensitive communication about, let's say, addiction.

44:46.980 --> 44:51.980
You know, groups like Alcoholics Anonymous or people with sexually transmitted diseases

44:51.980 --> 44:56.980
who form mutual support groups, and you certainly don't want your friends and family or your

44:56.980 --> 44:59.980
co-workers to know about your participation in such groups.

44:59.980 --> 45:02.980
So, that's why privacy is super important.

45:02.980 --> 45:08.980
Also, on the business side, if you have confidential business negotiations, for example, the previous

45:08.980 --> 45:13.980
thing I said about, you know, two companies have, you know, a startup and a big pharmaceutical

45:13.980 --> 45:16.980
engaging in intensive communications.

45:16.980 --> 45:18.980
That's, again, where you need privacy.

45:18.980 --> 45:23.980
And, last but not least, even law enforcement, which you would think normally is against privacy,

45:23.980 --> 45:27.980
because, you know, it's fundamentally, like, about uncovering things.

45:27.980 --> 45:31.980
Even they benefit from privacy.

45:31.980 --> 45:39.980
When they mount sting operations and set up honeypots for all kinds of miscreants out there.

45:39.980 --> 45:42.980
When they do secretly communicating in the public network.

45:42.980 --> 45:48.980
Like, for example, you know, with informers, secret informers or secret agents.

45:48.980 --> 45:54.980
As I said, okay, I already said digital cash.

45:54.980 --> 45:56.980
Also, anonymous electronic voting.

45:56.980 --> 46:01.980
One day, I hope, in not too distant future, we will have internet voting.

46:01.980 --> 46:05.980
Might not happen for a while, but I hope it will.

46:05.980 --> 46:10.980
Because it will definitely raise, lower the barriers for voting participation.

46:10.980 --> 46:15.980
And, just like we vote today, sort of anonymously, right?

46:15.980 --> 46:20.980
It would be nice to vote better anonymously on the internet.

46:20.980 --> 46:21.980
But, secure.

46:21.980 --> 46:24.980
So, the idea is not to give up on security.

46:24.980 --> 46:30.980
The idea is to still have secure voting, but in a way that's anonymous.

46:30.980 --> 46:31.980
Okay?

46:31.980 --> 46:37.980
Today, is the voting anonymous?

46:37.980 --> 46:39.980
No.

46:39.980 --> 46:42.980
Why do you say that?

46:42.980 --> 46:45.980
No, I'm just curious about your intuition.

46:45.980 --> 46:50.980
Because the ballot, it has your name on it.

46:50.980 --> 46:51.980
Does it?

46:51.980 --> 46:52.980
Yeah.

46:54.980 --> 46:55.980
When is it?

46:55.980 --> 46:56.980
Did somebody vote recently?

46:56.980 --> 46:58.980
Yeah, I voted in November.

46:58.980 --> 46:59.980
In November.

46:59.980 --> 47:00.980
And your ballot had a name.

47:00.980 --> 47:02.980
Did you vote by mail?

47:02.980 --> 47:03.980
No.

47:03.980 --> 47:04.980
In person?

47:04.980 --> 47:05.980
Yeah.

47:05.980 --> 47:06.980
Okay.

47:06.980 --> 47:07.980
I vote by mail, generally.

47:07.980 --> 47:09.980
So, my ballot had no name.

47:09.980 --> 47:13.980
The envelope is the problem.

47:13.980 --> 47:16.980
Also, I have no proof, actually, that the ballot had no name.

47:16.980 --> 47:18.980
It could have had a watermark that I didn't see.

47:18.980 --> 47:22.980
You see, the problem in the physical world, we put a lot of faith in, like, yeah, it's

47:22.980 --> 47:23.980
supposed to be anonymous.

47:23.980 --> 47:28.980
But, when you go into a precinct, so you went to a precinct, and then, did they check

47:28.980 --> 47:29.980
your ID?

47:29.980 --> 47:30.980
No.

47:30.980 --> 47:33.980
Right, because it's not, that law is not here yet.

47:33.980 --> 47:37.980
The government is trying to make it, make it come to life.

47:37.980 --> 47:40.980
But, did they check your name on the roster?

47:40.980 --> 47:41.980
Yeah.

47:41.980 --> 47:44.980
So, somebody knows if you're voted, right?

47:44.980 --> 47:45.980
Yeah.

47:45.980 --> 47:50.980
So, the thing is, even if the ballot isn't anonymous, sorry, is anonymous, if the ballot

47:50.980 --> 47:58.980
is anonymous, somebody, the precinct worker, crossed your name, and said, uh-huh, he or

47:58.980 --> 48:00.980
she voted, right?

48:00.980 --> 48:03.980
So, that's already, like, you're sacrificing privacy, right?

48:03.980 --> 48:06.980
You cannot say, I'm not saying I voted, I didn't vote.

48:06.980 --> 48:07.980
No.

48:07.980 --> 48:08.980
You voted.

48:08.980 --> 48:09.980
You voted.

48:09.980 --> 48:11.980
If someone voted, it's actually public, right?

48:11.980 --> 48:13.980
It is, but should it be?

48:13.980 --> 48:14.980
I understand.

48:14.980 --> 48:15.980
Should it be?

48:15.980 --> 48:25.980
Also, what if he walked in, got his name checked, went inside the ballot's, uh, what

48:25.980 --> 48:26.980
is it called?

48:26.980 --> 48:27.980
A tent, right?

48:27.980 --> 48:31.980
It's like a, it's like a changing room, right?

48:31.980 --> 48:34.980
And never voted, and walked out.

48:34.980 --> 48:36.980
Good, right?

48:36.980 --> 48:41.980
I've heard of people doing that.

48:41.980 --> 48:44.980
Anyway, voting is interesting, and also it's censorship-resistant publishing.

48:44.980 --> 48:48.980
That is, publishing, there's something, or putting something on, let's say, on the web,

48:48.980 --> 48:52.980
they cannot be taken down, because nobody knows where it is.

48:52.980 --> 48:53.980
Imagine that.

48:53.980 --> 48:58.980
You have something to say, maybe it's good, maybe it's bad, okay?

48:58.980 --> 49:01.980
Censorship does not distinguish between good and bad things.

49:01.980 --> 49:06.980
You have something to say, somebody, or, let's say, the government hates it, and wants

49:06.980 --> 49:09.980
it taken down, but they can't, because they don't know where it is.

49:09.980 --> 49:14.980
That's called censorship-resistant publishing.

49:14.980 --> 49:19.980
Oh, of course, where there's good, there's bad, and this is the problem right away that

49:19.980 --> 49:24.980
should be, it should be obvious to you, that anonymity has two sides, okay?

49:24.980 --> 49:27.980
Very much depends on which side you look from.

49:27.980 --> 49:29.980
The usual thing, right?

49:29.980 --> 49:32.980
If you have anonymity, it will be abused.

49:32.980 --> 49:38.980
There's no way to separate anonymity for the good from anonymity for the bad.

49:38.980 --> 49:45.980
All kinds of things, misinformation, propaganda, illegal substances, right?

49:45.980 --> 49:50.980
All kinds of illegal, murder for hire, sure.

49:50.980 --> 49:53.980
Chemical weapons, sure.

49:53.980 --> 49:56.980
Poisons, yeah.

49:56.980 --> 50:02.980
Drugs, probably most of you are too young to remember the Silk Road.

50:02.980 --> 50:07.980
If you look up Silk Road, that was a marketplace.

50:07.980 --> 50:11.980
There was a whole marketplace for illegal substances and illegal activities.

50:11.980 --> 50:17.980
The guy who ran it, there was even a movie about it, I think Ross Obrecht was his name.

50:17.980 --> 50:20.980
I think the president pardoned him recently.

50:20.980 --> 50:26.980
He was serving a very lengthy jail sentence in a federal prison.

50:26.980 --> 50:28.980
But anyway, that was taken down.

50:28.980 --> 50:34.980
But there are other marketplaces out there for illegal substances and illegal acts.

50:34.980 --> 50:39.980
And they cannot be taken down because the way they operate is beyond the reach of the law.

50:39.980 --> 50:41.980
Because of anonymity.

50:41.980 --> 50:44.980
Tax avoidance, yes.

50:44.980 --> 50:52.980
There are some cryptocurrency tricks that try to circumvent the anonymity I mentioned earlier.

50:52.980 --> 50:55.980
And also just general incitement to criminal activity.

50:55.980 --> 51:03.980
Let's say you want to use censorship resistant publishing that I mentioned earlier on the previous slide for the purposes of inciting terrorism.

51:03.980 --> 51:08.980
Well, your opinion is terrorism is legit.

51:08.980 --> 51:12.980
And the government is trying to censor you by attempting to take it down.

51:12.980 --> 51:16.980
Well, one person in terrorism is another person in freedom of fire.

51:16.980 --> 51:17.980
Or you want to incite murder.

51:17.980 --> 51:19.980
Or you want to incite genocide.

51:19.980 --> 51:20.980
Sure.

51:20.980 --> 51:22.980
That's freedom of speech for some.

51:22.980 --> 51:26.980
And prohibited pain speech for others.

51:26.980 --> 51:29.980
So, anonymity has two sides.

51:29.980 --> 51:30.980
But what is it really?

51:30.980 --> 51:32.980
Let's try to begin.

51:32.980 --> 51:39.980
I'm going to try to say that it's like inability to identify someone.

51:39.980 --> 51:45.980
An inability to identify someone with something within a set of subjects.

51:45.980 --> 51:49.980
Now, the size of the set can vary.

51:49.980 --> 51:56.980
And the fewer subjects in a set, the worse anonymity is, right?

51:56.980 --> 52:06.980
So, if I turn my back to the board and somebody throws a spitball at my back, surely some of you have done this in high school,

52:06.980 --> 52:09.980
I will know that somebody threw a spitball at me.

52:09.980 --> 52:11.980
I will feel it.

52:11.980 --> 52:14.980
I'm sensitive.

52:14.980 --> 52:19.980
But there are 14 people here.

52:19.980 --> 52:21.980
Which one?

52:21.980 --> 52:23.980
Is it the guy who is smiling?

52:23.980 --> 52:25.980
Or is it somebody with a poker face?

52:25.980 --> 52:28.980
Is it the person pretending to type on their phone?

52:28.980 --> 52:30.980
Or actually typing on their phone?

52:30.980 --> 52:33.980
Pretending to be very occupied or looking up in the sky?

52:33.980 --> 52:34.980
I have no idea.

52:34.980 --> 52:35.980
That's anonymity.

52:35.980 --> 52:38.980
You throw a spitball at me when my back is turned.

52:38.980 --> 52:39.980
I don't have eyes in the back of my head.

52:39.980 --> 52:42.980
You are anonymous in a group of 14.

52:42.980 --> 52:44.980
Okay?

52:44.980 --> 52:49.980
Now, if there are two of you here, wow, my job is easier.

52:49.980 --> 52:54.980
I might look at your fingers and, you know, or something.

52:54.980 --> 52:57.980
But, yeah, 14 is good enough for that.

52:57.980 --> 53:02.980
So, different from privacy, right?

53:02.980 --> 53:09.980
In other words, one cannot be anonymous alone, right?

53:09.980 --> 53:15.980
So, if there is one only person here and I feel the spitball hitting my back, I don't know this.

53:15.980 --> 53:17.980
That's definitely the culprit.

53:17.980 --> 53:20.980
That's it.

53:20.980 --> 53:22.980
There is other shades of anonymity.

53:22.980 --> 53:27.980
One is called unlinkability and the other we call unobservability.

53:27.980 --> 53:28.980
Okay?

53:28.980 --> 53:34.980
Unlinkability is an inability to connect multiple actions or action and identity.

53:34.980 --> 53:42.980
Like, in the spitball example, I also get more than anonymity, I get unlinkability.

53:42.980 --> 53:44.980
The action was spitball.

53:44.980 --> 53:49.980
But I cannot link an identity to that action.

53:49.980 --> 53:52.980
I know it's someone, but I cannot link an identity.

53:52.980 --> 53:53.980
Do you see this?

53:53.980 --> 53:54.980
Do you see this?

53:54.980 --> 53:55.980
The action occurred.

53:55.980 --> 53:57.980
I know the action occurred.

53:57.980 --> 53:59.980
Spitball hit me.

53:59.980 --> 54:00.980
Somebody launched it.

54:00.980 --> 54:01.980
But who?

54:01.980 --> 54:02.980
I don't know.

54:02.980 --> 54:03.980
So, I can't link.

54:03.980 --> 54:04.980
Or, suppose this.

54:04.980 --> 54:05.980
Twice this happened.

54:05.980 --> 54:06.980
Twice.

54:06.980 --> 54:07.980
My back is turned.

54:07.980 --> 54:08.980
Bam!

54:08.980 --> 54:09.980
Spitball.

54:09.980 --> 54:10.980
Some minutes later, my back is turned again.

54:10.980 --> 54:11.980
Bam!

54:11.980 --> 54:12.980
Another spitball.

54:12.980 --> 54:13.980
Okay.

54:13.980 --> 54:14.980
I know.

54:14.980 --> 54:15.980
Two spitballs.

54:15.980 --> 54:16.980
But let's say this guy, I want to hit me.

54:16.980 --> 54:17.980
Hit me.

54:17.980 --> 54:18.980
Hit me.

54:18.980 --> 54:19.980
Somebody launched it.

54:19.980 --> 54:20.980
But who?

54:20.980 --> 54:21.980
I don't know.

54:21.980 --> 54:22.980
So, I can't link.

54:22.980 --> 54:23.980
Or, suppose this.

54:23.980 --> 54:24.980
Twice this happened.

54:24.980 --> 54:25.980
Twice.

54:25.980 --> 54:26.980
Twice.

54:26.980 --> 54:27.980
My back is turned.

54:27.980 --> 54:28.980
Bam!

54:28.980 --> 54:30.980
Let's say this guy over here.

54:30.980 --> 54:32.980
Let's meet him a little seeker.

54:32.980 --> 54:37.980
He says, you know, it's the same person.

54:37.980 --> 54:39.980
Snitch.

54:39.980 --> 54:41.980
That means I have linkability.

54:41.980 --> 54:42.980
I just linked.

54:42.980 --> 54:45.980
I don't know who it is, but I know it's the same person.

54:45.980 --> 54:46.980
You see?

54:46.980 --> 54:51.980
But if he doesn't tell me, I know that two actions occurred, but I can't link them.

54:51.980 --> 54:53.980
I mean, they asked spitballs.

54:53.980 --> 54:54.980
Both.

54:54.980 --> 54:57.980
But it could have been done by two different people.

54:57.980 --> 55:00.980
So, inability to link is unlinkability.

55:00.980 --> 55:03.980
If he rats on somebody, it's just partially rats on somebody.

55:03.980 --> 55:05.980
You know, it's the same person.

55:05.980 --> 55:06.980
All I can tell you is the same person.

55:06.980 --> 55:08.980
Oh, now I have more information.

55:08.980 --> 55:09.980
There's one person.

55:09.980 --> 55:10.980
It was not a random act.

55:10.980 --> 55:12.980
That one person did it twice.

55:12.980 --> 55:13.980
Okay?

55:13.980 --> 55:21.980
So, a more appropriate example, perhaps, is connecting Alice to a sent email.

55:21.980 --> 55:24.980
Now, I know that email was sent, right?

55:24.980 --> 55:27.980
And if I can't link it to the sender, that's unlinkability.

55:27.980 --> 55:32.980
But if I can link it to Alice, then I know Alice sent email.

55:32.980 --> 55:35.980
I might not know what it is.

55:35.980 --> 55:40.980
It might be well encrypted, but I know she sent email.

55:40.980 --> 55:45.980
Or, I see two emails, both encrypted.

55:45.980 --> 55:49.980
I don't know who sent them, but I know it's the same sender.

55:49.980 --> 55:50.980
Okay?

55:50.980 --> 55:51.980
That's linkability.

55:51.980 --> 55:56.980
Inability to do that is unlinkable.

55:56.980 --> 56:02.980
And then, last, sort of, the impacts of anonymity is called unobservability.

56:02.980 --> 56:04.980
And that's very hard to achieve.

56:04.980 --> 56:13.980
Here, if you observe, you don't know when a second action took place.

56:13.980 --> 56:14.980
Okay?

56:14.980 --> 56:20.980
So, let's say the room is completely dark.

56:20.980 --> 56:21.980
Okay?

56:21.980 --> 56:23.980
The room is completely dark.

56:23.980 --> 56:24.980
You cannot see me.

56:24.980 --> 56:26.980
I cannot see you, but I know you're here.

56:26.980 --> 56:28.980
So, imagine right now all the lights go dark.

56:28.980 --> 56:30.980
It's completely dark.

56:30.980 --> 56:35.980
And then, 30 seconds later, the lights go on.

56:35.980 --> 56:40.980
My question is, did somebody throw a spitball anywhere?

56:44.980 --> 56:48.980
I didn't feel it, but did somebody do throw a spitball anywhere in the room?

56:48.980 --> 56:49.980
I don't know.

56:49.980 --> 56:50.980
Maybe.

56:50.980 --> 56:51.980
Maybe not.

56:51.980 --> 56:53.980
Do you see the difference?

56:53.980 --> 56:58.980
An action may have occurred, or may not have occurred, I don't know.

56:58.980 --> 57:04.980
So, that inability to tell what happened, just that the action happened, is, by itself,

57:04.980 --> 57:05.980
unobservability.

57:05.980 --> 57:06.980
That's really hard.

57:06.980 --> 57:18.980
So, how do you undermine anonymity, well, by now it should be kind of obvious, right?

57:18.980 --> 57:19.980
Passive traffic analysis.

57:19.980 --> 57:23.980
Looking at IP traffic.

57:23.980 --> 57:25.980
Looking at Ethernet traffic.

57:25.980 --> 57:26.980
Why Ethernet?

57:26.980 --> 57:27.980
Why Ethernet?

57:27.980 --> 57:34.980
Well, at the MAC layer, you still see, remember, MAC addresses, right?

57:34.980 --> 57:38.980
Even if, because, let's say, in a wireless menu, we use encryption, right?

57:38.980 --> 57:39.980
There's wireless encryption, right?

57:39.980 --> 57:41.980
There's wireless encryption protocols.

57:41.980 --> 57:44.980
So, they hide even the IP header.

57:44.980 --> 57:47.980
If you're confused, why am I saying this?

57:47.980 --> 57:53.980
Because, remember, IP packets, once they go on the internet, once they usually pass the

57:53.980 --> 57:55.980
first wireless hop, right?

57:55.980 --> 57:58.980
They are IP packets.

57:58.980 --> 58:01.980
Meaning, that you can see the heads, right?

58:01.980 --> 58:04.980
You can see IP, you know, IP heads.

58:04.980 --> 58:07.980
But, on our first wireless hop, right?

58:07.980 --> 58:14.980
Like this, from here, from here to the access point, there's usually a wireless security protocol

58:14.980 --> 58:24.980
that encrypts the IP packet between my device and the access point.

58:24.980 --> 58:31.980
So, if you were observing traffic, what you would be able to see, then, is Ethernet headers.

58:31.980 --> 58:34.980
Meaning, MAC addresses, right?

58:34.980 --> 58:36.980
Source, destination.

58:36.980 --> 58:38.980
But, that's also information, right?

58:38.980 --> 58:43.980
Because, you can tell that it's, if you know the source, you'll know it's my phone

58:43.980 --> 58:45.980
that's using that MAC address.

58:45.980 --> 58:47.980
The destination will be access point.

58:47.980 --> 58:49.980
But, if we're using, what is it called?

58:49.980 --> 58:50.980
Direct Wi-Fi?

58:50.980 --> 58:52.980
But, no direct Wi-Fi.

58:52.980 --> 58:53.980
Appear Wi-Fi.

58:53.980 --> 58:56.980
That's what you don't have access point.

58:56.980 --> 59:00.980
But, let's say, talk directly, like me talking directly to his laptop.

59:00.980 --> 59:02.980
We can do that.

59:02.980 --> 59:03.980
Not easy to set up.

59:03.980 --> 59:05.980
Not a lot of people use it, but you can, right?

59:05.980 --> 59:11.980
So, in that case, if you snoop on traffic, you will be able to observe that my Ethernet MAC address

59:11.980 --> 59:14.980
is talking to his Ethernet MAC address.

59:14.980 --> 59:18.980
So, that's passive traffic analysis, right?

59:18.980 --> 59:26.980
So, the idea is, if you want to hide patterns in traffic, you have to not only communicate

59:26.980 --> 59:29.980
sparingly, but you also have to carry other people's traffic.

59:29.980 --> 59:33.980
Like, relay other people's traffic to obscure patterns.

59:33.980 --> 59:36.980
And, we'll see how that's done later.

59:36.980 --> 59:37.980
There's more.

59:37.980 --> 59:42.980
There's also active traffic analysis, which means injecting traffic and seeing if I can

59:42.980 --> 59:46.980
recognize it as it traverses some route.

59:46.980 --> 59:49.980
Put it on timing signatures.

59:49.980 --> 59:50.980
That's later.

59:50.980 --> 59:57.980
You can also, if you compromise routers, well, then you don't need to worry about snooping on traffic, right?

59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.980
Routers, by definition, receive traffic and forward it.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:06.980
So, they don't need to tap any wires or any kind of medium, right?

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:10.980
They naturally receive traffic and send it on its way.

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:15.980
And, you will never know if a router is compromised, right?

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:23.980
Because it's running malicious software that actually logs or examines communication patterns.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:29.980
That's done silently.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.980
So, from history.

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:40.980
Back in 1981, ancient history, 44 years ago, a guy named David Chow, a brilliantly paranoid

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:46.980
and crazy person who might have sort of dubious pleasure of meeting a few times.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.980
Because brilliant scientists are always very nice people.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.980
And, this guy's an example.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.980
But, he's brilliant and should get a Turing Award.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.980
He's old, but he's alive.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.980
And, actually, should get a Turing Award one of his years.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:02.980
He published several papers.

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:07.980
One of them was a communication with ACM called untraceable electronic mail return addresses

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.980
and digital series.

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:17.980
Mind you, 1981 was, should, I was in middle school, high school.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:18.980
I mean, internet.

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.980
I had never heard of the internet.

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:27.980
So, that was only like maybe 81 and maybe a few thousand people around the world that knew of internet.

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:34.980
And, this guy was already thinking ahead about the world we live today.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.980
Because, back then nobody cared about that anonymity.

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:38.980
So, you say, security?

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:39.980
Why?

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:40.980
Anonymity?

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:41.980
Who needs it?

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:48.980
But, that paper was laid the foundation for what today's, what today's anonymity and privacy tools are.

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:56.980
And, basically, the idea he laid out is that, he first made an argument why we need privacy and anonymity.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:02.980
And, then he sort of used this new concept called public encryption because public encryption was run from like late 70s.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:09.980
So, he used this very new cryptographic concept of public encryption with the concept of a trusted remailer.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.980
called the mix.

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:13.980
Okay?

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:18.980
And, just, mix works like this.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.980
And, it's the foundation actually.

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.980
It is the foundation of many, of today's anonymity systems.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:25.980
So, the idea is this.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.980
You have a bunch of users.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:31.980
And, the users want to send email to each other.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:37.980
So, now we're talking strictly about email because, back in the 1980s, there was no social networking.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.980
There was no instant messaging.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:40.980
There was no SMS.

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.980
There was no cell phones, really.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.980
So, people communicated.

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.980
If they wanted to communicate electronically, they communicated via email.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.980
And, the email looked pretty much like a dozen.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:03:00.980
So, the idea is to obscure or hide who is sending email to whom.

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:01.980
Okay?

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:08.980
So, we have A, C, D of Alice, Charlie, David, and then we have Bob and Eve.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.980
And, these are all users.

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:14.980
And, some of them want to send email to others.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:21.980
But, they don't want anybody observing that, anybody observing where that email goes.

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:29.980
So, you have here Alice, who wants to send an email to Bob.

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:35.980
But, she does not send it directly to Bob because, if she did, that would be observable.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:42.980
So, what she does is, she takes the message that she wants to send to Bob, called M.

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:50.980
Combines it with a NOS, a random value that she picks, R0.

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:57.980
And, she encrypts it under the public key of Bob, the receiver.

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.980
And, she takes the result, the encryption.

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:03.980
Combines it with another NOS, called R1.

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:04.980
Okay?

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:17.980
Appends the name of the recipient, B, and encrypts it under the well-known public key of the mix.

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:21.980
Now, the mix is not like the picture.

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.980
It's a computer.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.980
And, its job is to mix email.

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:29.980
But, it doesn't just mix.

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.980
It also decrypts and decrypts, et cetera.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.980
But, in this example, you'll see.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:39.980
So, now, A, instead of sending to, directly to Bob, Alice sends it to the mix.

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:50.980
Now, the idea is that when the mix gets that email, it knows that all the emails coming to the mix are encrypted under the mix of public key.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:51.980
Right?

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.980
So, it tries to decrypt it.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980
It doesn't succeed.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:54.980
It throws it away.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:05:01.980
But, when it decrypts, what it finds inside is R0 and M encrypted, which you cannot read what it is.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.980
It doesn't see what M is.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:04.980
It doesn't know what R0 is.

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:08.980
But, he sees the name of B, Bob, right?

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.980
So, he says, that's what I'm going to send.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.980
Whatever I find inside, I'm going to send to Bob.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.980
You see that?

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:16.980
Easy.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.980
And, he does that.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:22.980
Now, imagine you are the observer.

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:26.980
And, you have seen that message from Alice to the mix.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:31.980
And, you have also seen the message from mix to Bob.

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:36.980
Can you say for sure that these are the same messages?

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.980
What can you tell me?

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:40.980
What can you tell me?

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.980
If there's no other messages, there's no message.

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:44.980
Right.

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:50.980
But, if somebody showed up and said, here's one message, here's the second message.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.980
Are they the same?

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.980
Can you tell them?

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:55.980
Huh?

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:56.980
No.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.980
You cannot.

01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:58.980
Right?

01:05:58.980 --> 01:05:59.980
You cannot.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:00.980
Because, how do you know?

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.980
If this message is encrypted under the big public key of the mix, and the other message

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.980
is encrypted under the public key of Bob.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.980
You cannot.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:05.980
You cannot.

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.980
Right?

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:07.980
You cannot.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:08.980
Because, how do you know?

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:14.980
If this message is encrypted under the big public key of the mix, and the other message

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:20.980
is encrypted under the public key of Bob.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:21.980
You cannot correlate.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:22.980
You cannot correlate.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:27.980
But, you are correct if you also know that this message was the only message coming into

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:28.980
the mix.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:34.980
And, very soon afterwards, that message was encrypted, and very likely they had the same

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:35.980
message.

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:41.980
Because the mix sent only one message, and before that he received this one message, it

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.980
must be a chain reaction, right?

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.980
Well, that's not how we use a mix, right?

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:47.980
You can imagine.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.980
The idea of a mix is to mix things.

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:58.980
So, a mix is to receive many emails like this.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:06:59.980
Okay?

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.980
Now, this is a toy example, mind you.

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.980
In the real world, this would be hundreds and maybe thousands of messages received in

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.980
very close succession, right?

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:13.980
One after another, or nearly simultaneously.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:15.980
So, look at what happens.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.980
In this example, there are only three incoming messages.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:21.980
Charlie wants to send a message to Eve.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:24.980
He encrypts it similarly, you see?

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:27.980
David wants to send a message to Bob.

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:28.980
He encrypts it similarly, right?

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:33.980
Everything is the same format, right?

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:44.980
And what the mix actually does is output the three messages in a blast at the same time.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.980
Or you can imagine either at the same time or in some random order.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:52.980
But the order in which it outputs, it has nothing to do with the order in which it received.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:08:01.980
Now, you're again the observer who sees what's coming into the mix and what is leaving the mix.

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.980
Can you map incoming to outgoing messages?

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:08.980
Probabilistically?

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:10.980
Only probabilistically, yeah.

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:13.980
This is a silly example, right?

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:16.980
Can you say, who sent a message to Eve?

01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:20.980
Well, it could be one-third, right?

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:21.980
Probability.

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.980
It's either Alice, Charlie, or David.

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:25.980
Who sends a message to Bob?

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:34.980
Well, it's either Alice and Charlie, Alice and David, or Charlie and David, right?

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.980
You know everybody sent a message.

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:41.980
What you don't know is to whom.

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:46.980
But now, think about generalizing this to hundreds of messages and thousands of messages.

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:48.980
And many thousands of recipients.

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:50.980
Right?

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.980
Both senders and receivers.

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.980
Then it becomes very difficult to associate.

01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.980
So the main thing is that, of course, the mix does not need three messages to start sending.

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:03.980
It needs to receive a patch that is big enough.

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:05.980
Right?

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:08.980
And that's configurable and you can set it to like 10,000.

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:12.980
So, a mix receives 10,000 messages, then it outputs them in random form.

01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:13.980
Yeah?

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:18.980
Can you just see that Alice is always in a batch that sends a message to Bob, but whenever

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.980
there's a batch to Alice, it doesn't make me never send a message to Bob.

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:23.980
Yes.

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:25.980
Yes.

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:26.980
You can.

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:31.980
And then, maybe you can think, you can deduce that Alice did not send a message to Bob,

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.980
or she did send a message to Bob at some point.

01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:34.980
Yes.

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:39.980
But, again, with a large enough scaling factor, this should be really, really difficult.

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:44.980
I imagine there's some endpoints that never get message sent in the ticker.

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.980
Aha!

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:46.980
Yes.

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:47.980
And there are defenses against that as well.

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:49.980
Okay?

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:57.980
In the general system, what happens is, I mean, this is like if you want to maximize or minimize

01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:58.980
kind of the performance levels.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.980
You do this.

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.980
You output as many messages as a mix, output as many messages as you see.

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:13.980
There are also very naive or nothing, very intuitive strategies to obscure and prevent attacks

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:14.980
like you just have.

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:19.980
And they involve chaffing or generating spurious traffic.

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:28.980
So the idea is that every user of the mix will randomly send traffic that goes nowhere.

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.980
You see what I'm saying?

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:32.980
Yes.

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:33.980
Right?

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.980
It will just send traffic to a special destination called X.

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.980
And there's no X.

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:46.980
So when the mix receives a packet and receives a message, decrypts it, and she sees destination

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.980
X, it says, oh, this is chaff.

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:49.980
Throw it.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:50.980
Okay?

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:57.980
So that says that Alice, that obscures the true number of packets or mail messages that

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.980
Alice sends or every user sends.

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:06.980
In addition to that, a mix can generate spurious messages to random destinations as well.

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.980
A chaff, right?

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:11.980
You will pick, like, there are no messages for Bob in this batch.

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:15.980
Oh, let's send a message to Bob and Charlie and Edward and this.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.980
Okay?

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.980
Well, let's send more messages than there really are.

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:23.980
And they will be marked specifically so that when the destination, the actual destination

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.980
receives them, they'll just throw them away.

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.980
So that's one way to obscure.

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:34.980
Does anybody know why R0 is necessary?

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:41.980
If Alice sends the same message to Bob multiple times, if you don't have R0 and there's a

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:42.980
little bit of a caveat, if the public key encryption is deterministic, then this message R0, that's

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.980
the same.

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.980
This message from mixed to Bob would be the same.

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:45.980
No?

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:46.980
No?

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.980
No?

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:48.980
No?

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:49.980
No?

01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:50.980
No?

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:51.980
No.

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:52.980
No.

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:53.980
No.

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:54.980
No.

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:55.980
No.

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:56.980
No.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:57.980
No.

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:58.980
No.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.980
No.

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:00.980
No.

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:01.980
No.

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:02.980
No.

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:03.980
No.

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:04.980
No.

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:05.980
No.

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:06.980
No.

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:07.980
No.

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:08.980
No.

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:09.980
No.

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:10.980
No.

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:11.980
No.

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:13.980
No.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:14.980
No.

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:15.980
No.

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:16.980
No.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:17.980
No.

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:18.980
No.

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:19.980
No.

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:20.980
No.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:21.980
No.

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.980
No.

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.980
No.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:27.980
No.

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:28.980
No.

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:29.980
No.

01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:30.980
No, no.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:31.980
No.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:32.980
No, no, no.

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:35.380
Like why do I have these?

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:37.180
That's more of it.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.000
Not really necessary.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.420
Like extra randomization.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.140
But does everybody see how a mix works?

01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:45.820
Okay.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.500
All right, let's end here.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:48.820
See you on Thursday.
