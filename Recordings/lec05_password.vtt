WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
later in the course. That is, there was a back-end SQL database, very large database, that was somehow accessible via external web server.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Anyway, you see the pointers here, you can still read about these.

00:22.000 --> 00:32.000
That is just a nice playground to analyze, and here are some statistics, some takeaways from that database.

00:32.000 --> 00:44.000
These are top 20 passwords, and what you see is the rank, the password, and the number of users that selected that password.

00:44.000 --> 01:00.000
Some of those are totally not surprising, right? Like ABC 1-3, 1-8, 1-7, Roku, because it's a Roku database.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
Princess, I don't know, I can't explain princess, I don't know what that's about, but I love you, password, okay, those are easy to explain.

01:09.000 --> 01:18.000
Monkey, I don't know, that must be a term of endearment in the UK, but then we'll be fine here.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
Names, mostly female names for some reason, okay, maybe that's because most of the users were male.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
This is the gaming side of it, so it's fair to prove the majority of the users were male.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Right, so that's kind of depressing.

01:36.000 --> 01:59.000
Now, we'll come back to passwords later, but one of the things I want to illustrate is that sometimes companies, websites, and organizations come up with clever tricks to make it easy for users to pick passwords or pick and memorize pins.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Now, in this case, banks typically use pins, right?

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
For website access, they use password, but for ATM access, right, they use pins.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Also, on the phone, they often ask you, if you call a bank, they'll ask you for a pin.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
And so, if you let users pick pins, you'll have the same problems as with passwords.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Users will pick dates, typically, right?

02:26.000 --> 02:36.000
Or some kind of very familiar, predictable things like, I don't know, a street address or a phone number, right?

02:36.000 --> 02:44.000
So, dates, street addresses, phone numbers are the most common choices for pins if you leave users the freedom to pick them.

02:44.000 --> 02:54.000
So, this bank in the UK wanted to make it easy for users to memorize their pins.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
But the pins were supposed to be random, okay?

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Meaning, the bank would come up with a random pin and assign it to the user.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Are you with me?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Alright.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
This happens here, too, even today, right?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Some banks do that.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Definitely, my bank did it about 10 years ago, and they stopped.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
So, what they said is like this.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
If you basically get a grid, like this, you see, a 4 by 10 grid.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
And the top row is the numbers, right?

03:30.000 --> 03:38.000
So, if the bank gives you a password, sorry, a pin that is 4 digits,

03:38.000 --> 03:47.000
you basically pick your favorite 4 character word that you know you will remember,

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
and write it down from left to right on this grid.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
So, in this example, the bank gave the password, sorry, a pin 2256.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
That's presumably a randomly generated pin.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
And the user happens to write the word blue, because 4 digits, right?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
4 characters, blue.

04:11.000 --> 04:20.000
So, if the user writes the word blue on this grid, where that 22, right?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Because BL are under 2, because that means the first characters,

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
the first digits should be 2 and 2.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
And then UE, 5, 6, right?

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
So, the idea is that then, once the user has written it down,

04:39.000 --> 04:48.000
all the other squares in this table are filled in with random characters.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Are you with me?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Now imagine, I wish I had better animation here,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
imagine the rest of the squares filled with random characters,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
also written in the same typeface in black, okay?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
So, you cannot tell, right?

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
And the point of this is that, if you look at this cheat sheet, right?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
You print this out, right?

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
You carry this around, this cheat sheet.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
It only makes sense to you.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
You'll remember your pin, because what you will do,

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
is you'll always remember your word, blue, right?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Blue is your favorite four-letter word.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
So, when somebody else looks at this table,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
and it's filled in with random garbage, right?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
It's basically a bunch of letters.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
They don't know.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
You look puzzled.

05:40.000 --> 05:49.000
So, normally, in order to guess a pin, a four-digit pin,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
you would have to try up to, usually half,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
10,000 possibilities, right?

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
There are 10,000 four-digit numbers.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
On average, if you want to break somebody's pin,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
you would have to try 5,000, right?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
On average.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
But, in this case, if somebody gets a hold of,

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
or takes a snapshot of this table,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
it might seem like, oh,

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
there's lots of possibilities here, right?

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
At least as many as 10,000, right?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Because, actually, it's like this.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Look at that.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
There are four rows that are empty under the number row, right?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
And then there are 10 rows, right?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Sorry, 10 columns.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So, we have, basically,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
4 times 4 times 4,

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
4 to the 10th, right?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Which is 2 to the 20 possibilities

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
of combinations of letters, right?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Actually, it's more,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
because you can do the things you can have.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
So, it seems like if you look at the combination of letters,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
it's even more than there are pins.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
But the truth is something else.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
If somebody takes a snapshot,

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
or steals a copy of this cheat sheet,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
all they have to do is look for English words,

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
from left to right, right?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
They can go down and sideways,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
or they can go just sideways, right?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Human eyes are good at that.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
So, in fact, if you're looking for four-letter English words

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
in a randomly jumbled matrix,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
where there is really just one four-letter English words,

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
there may be some accidental ones, right?

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
You will completely shortcut the pin-breaking process.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
There will be maybe a few dozen possibilities

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
of four-letter English words,

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
and one of them will be blue.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
So, that's an example of a clever trick

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
that makes it way easier for an adversary to attack the system.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Okay?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
You still look puzzled.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Don't believe me?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Anybody?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Don't be afraid to ask.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Now, remember, it's all left to right, right?

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
The digits have to be moving, right?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
There's your pin.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
You have to remember your pin as you, the user, the owner,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
has to remember your pin, right?

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
And so, you write a four-letter word,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
but it's not written like this.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
It's written in a certain way, right?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
You have to be able to parse that word, find it.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
You remember the word.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You look at this, you say, you're looking for,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
if the word is blue, you're looking for the letter B.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Then you're looking for L, right?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Where's L?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Oh, it's here.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
There's U.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
There's E.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Okay?

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Now, if you think that standard tricks like,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I don't know, spelling words backwards.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
This is a typical children's trick, right?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
This is the spell.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Some kids even play games with, like, speaking words backwards.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
It helps, it does not.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
Because the password databases that are out there already have them.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
First and last names, common first and last names.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
Most first and last names are just well-known and easy to calculate.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
Street names, city names, state names, place names, mountain names.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
All of those things are easily enumerable.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
And all geographical locations in the world, in fact, are.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Same goes with upper lowercase.

09:53.000 --> 10:03.000
If you know at least the scope of what users you are trying to have,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
driver's license numbers, right?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
If you know somebody is likely to live in California

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
and have a California driver's license number,

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
well, guess what?

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
All California driver's license numbers have a very similar format, right?

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
Like my driver's license, C6715402.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Okay?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Well, there's not a lot of digits there.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I mean, it's enough, but you can enumerate all of them.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
License plates are also in kind of sequential.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
License plates.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
In California.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Well, there's that.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
There was a time when even social security numbers had a structure.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Today, they don't.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
But back in my day, you could look at a social security number and say,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
oh, I know which state this comes from.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
And I know roughly what year you are going to assign this social security number.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Today, they're not like that.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Okay.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Same goes for telephone numbers.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Point of language is if you think, oh, well, you know,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I'm going to use Swahili.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Meh.

11:05.000 --> 11:15.000
Most common foreign languages are easily enumerable and stored in these password database.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Probably the best combination, and this is not something I can give you a proof for,

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
is if you don't want to use, let's say, if you're not good at picking things with special symbols

11:25.000 --> 11:35.000
or remembering numbers, the best thing you can do is pick, I would say, three or more languages,

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
three is a good number, that you do not speak.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Okay?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
And other people know you don't speak.

11:44.000 --> 11:51.000
Because if people know you speak a particular foreign language, that helps in the attack, right?

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
Especially assume that people who will attack you are people who might know something about you.

11:56.000 --> 12:05.000
Like your CV, which is on LinkedIn, might say, I speak Farsi, or I speak Albanian.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Well, that's a leak.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
Because if you speak Farsi or Albanian, that is a high chance that you will pick a password from those languages.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Okay?

12:15.000 --> 12:23.000
So what you do is instead pick three languages that you do not speak, but you know a few words.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
You don't speak, but you know a few words from each.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Combine the three words, right?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Okay?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
And then you have a password.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
That makes it a lot harder for crap.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
It can still be crap, but it's a lot harder.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Okay.

12:40.000 --> 12:50.000
Well, then, in recent years, most reputable systems started to enforce length limits.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Meaning minimum length for a password, right?

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
What are the minimum lengths you see out there?

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Eight is probably the lower bound, right?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I haven't seen less than eight for passwords.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
For pins, it can be six, but eight, sometimes 12, right?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I have not seen more than 12.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Have anybody seen more than 12?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Right.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Have you seen upper limits?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Yes, right?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Upper limits exist.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
And, yeah, I think we discussed that already, I think, last time, right?

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Okay.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
So, let's say most are today between eight and 12, and then what do they do?

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
They require one upper lower case.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Sorry, let's say, right?

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
One, I guess they require mixed case, right?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Often, not all.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Most require at least one letter.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Sorry, at least one number.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
And if you use all numbers, they require at least one letter, right?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I believe that most people don't do that.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
And then one special character, right?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Which is usually for a minute.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
It does not often include like dollar sign or pound sign, right?

14:02.000 --> 14:09.000
It will be like comma, exclamation, question mark, something like that, right?

14:09.000 --> 14:19.000
And how effective is that, do you think?

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
I think people would try to use the minimum number of everything and then pattern that they...

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Right.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
That is true.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
The studies have shown that people will use the minimum.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
Studies show that people will use predictable things like, for example, you know, substituting i's with ones.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
Substituting o's with zeros.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Which makes it very, very pretty difficult.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
Adding one, two, three to the beginning or the end.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Adding usually exclamation points.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
The typical thing is add one bang or one exclamation point, right?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Just to satisfy it.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Just to get rid of the annoying checker, right?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
And let you...

15:01.000 --> 15:12.000
So, yes, it is effective because it increases the search space, but no, not by a lot.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
Also, using special characters is an interesting thing.

15:16.000 --> 15:26.000
Now, how many of you have, let's say, logged in using special characters from keyboards other than American keyboards?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Anyone?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Nobody else?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Non-quality keyboards, like European keyboards.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Or Asian keyboards.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Just one person.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Okay.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Well, I'll raise my hand, too.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
So, you know what?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Have you had any difficulties?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Not usually.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
I'm kind of using the different...

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
I use it.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Okay.

15:41.000 --> 15:54.000
Well, one of the things, if you go, let's say, to Europe, is you'll see the keyboards, although

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
they're kind of laid out, the letters are laid out in the same way, the special symbols aren't.

15:59.000 --> 16:06.000
So, like, add sign, pound sign, they're accessible by a different combination than they are in the U.S.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
That makes it a real pain.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Okay?

16:09.000 --> 16:17.000
So, whereas if you constrain your passwords to only letters and numbers, you don't have these issues.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Okay.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Well, then, what about these guys?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Now, we briefly talked about password vaults and managers, right?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
But let's consider them a little more seriously.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
People do use them.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Some companies actually require the use of this.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Okay?

16:31.000 --> 16:39.000
I'm not going to preach for or against them, but let's consider both sides of these things.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
I mean, it's kind of a cottage industry, too, right?

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
I mean, it's businesses that make money on it.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
As I mentioned before, when we, I think, briefly touched upon it, they have to provide the same level of security

16:51.000 --> 16:59.000
that a certification authority can provide for its CA, except that in this case, remember, the certification authority

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
has to be offline.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
You can have some physically secure location, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
Not connected to the internet, right?

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
This cannot be offline, right?

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
Because millions of users or thousands of users are using it all the time, right?

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
To retrieve passwords from the vault, right?

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
So the security requirements are harder.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Because if something is online, it can be accessed, right?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
It's reachable.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Okay, but the good things are what?

17:36.000 --> 17:43.000
So if you use a password manager or password vault, where it's via an app or website, whatever,

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
you can have super strong passwords, random long passwords that you don't have to remember.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
It will remember them for you, right?

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Basically, what is the password vault of password manager?

17:57.000 --> 18:10.000
It has a small database for you, for your account, that lists all the websites or all the entities you do business with that require passwords.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
It has your username and it has your password in the clear somewhere, right?

18:16.000 --> 18:26.000
Because when you want to access the password manager and essentially to extract the password to enter into some website, it has to give you the password.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It cannot give you a hash, right?

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
It has to give you the whole thing.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
So, hmm.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
But anyway, it can have really strong passwords that you don't need to remember.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
It will make sure you don't reuse passwords across sites.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
Whereas, given freedom to do so, most people will be using passwords, right?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Most of you probably do too.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
I know I have.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
Because it's just a pain to remember a lot of passwords.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.000
So, you go to one place, it's nice and convenient, like a supermarket.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
You go there to get all your goods, and there's only one strong password to remember.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
The one that unlocks the vault, right?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
That's the password to other passwords.

19:18.000 --> 19:24.000
So, you could argue that that password could be strong and you should be forced to remember it, but it's only one.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
As opposed to many, so it's just basic goodness.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
But let's look at the bad side.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
The bad side, that becomes like, yeah, a giant pot of honey for bees.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Or, there's surely a better analogy somewhere.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
But, it is an attractive target, right?

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
This is, why do bank robbers rob the banks?

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Famously, because that's where the money is.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Well, why would somebody attack a password load?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Because that's where the passwords are.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
And you can get a lot with those passwords, right?

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
So, there's a lot at stake.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Also, there's such a thing as insider attack.

20:05.000 --> 20:13.000
Which is people who work for that company, who might go rogue one day, and decide to copy or steal information.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
And sell it on the black market.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Okay?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
For profit.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
Then there's just other operational issues.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
Not too much a security issue, but not strictly.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
Where this password vault becomes a single point of failure.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
It's basically a website, right?

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
You go to that website, or you access it by an app on your smartphone.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
It is an entity, right?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That has to be accessed.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
It isn't something that can be replicated on Akamai CDN.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
No, it's a physical entity that has to be accessed.

20:51.000 --> 21:00.000
And so, if they have software upgrade, like they did last August, if you recall there was an incident.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Right?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Maybe you do not recall.

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
That became a nightmare, because all the systems over the world, especially airlines, became inoperable.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Then you have an outage.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Or just somebody presses the wrong button, installs the wrong code, there's an outage.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
So this password vault is not accessible, because they're performing maintenance.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
Well, how are you going to get access to all the websites for which that vault knows the passwords, and you don't?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Just prove.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Denial of service attack.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
We'll talk about those later in the course.

21:34.000 --> 21:42.000
What if it is a massive distributed denial of service attack that essentially makes it impossible to access that password vault site?

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
Even though it's operational, but you can't access it.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
You're screwed.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
And then it could be just internet problems, right?

21:50.000 --> 22:00.000
If you have an internet problem, meaning a router that is somewhere on the way that an internet router or an internet provider crashes, you can't access it.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
And that completely gives you no service.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
So consider those when using the vault.

22:06.000 --> 22:14.000
Now, you might say, well, you know, if a smart company that runs one of those vaults wants to make the service ubiquitous, they will replicate things.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
Tell them, oh, but replicating passwords, that's a touchy-feely subject, right?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
How do you do that security?

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
And then you have to make sure that all the passwords are updated, right?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
On all replicas.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
Then, surely you're all familiar with screen unlocked.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
How many people use those?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Not anymore?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Wow, like five years ago.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Pretty much more than that.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
Three quarters of the class would be using it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Anybody used them before?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Okay.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
All right.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
See?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
When did you start?

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
When you switched to an iPhone or?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I think the phone all updated with Face ID.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
No matter Android or Android.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Right, right.

23:00.000 --> 23:07.000
So that's what I also, I never used these screen patterns unlocked, but I know people did.

23:07.000 --> 23:14.000
At one point, everybody, it seemed to me like everybody was using it.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
So, yeah, you're right.

23:16.000 --> 23:24.000
The face unlock and the fingerprint, to a lesser extent, became a more common way of unlocking, because it required no real effort.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Right?

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
But the claim to fame of the screen unlock, right?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
That pattern was it's easy to remember.

23:32.000 --> 23:42.000
Somehow, it felt like, I mean, at least studies at the time showed that it's easier for people to remember the unlock patterns than it is to remember pins.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Right?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Because phones usually don't take passwords, right?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Phones were traditionally unlocked with pins.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
It's just easier because phones have limited real estate, right?

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
On the screen, just playing a keyboard is awkward.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Right?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
It is awkward.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Right?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Even for people with tiny fingers.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
So, cool.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Back.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
Easy to remember, easy to enter, right?

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Just use your fingertips.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
They're more intuitive than passwords.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
That's for sure.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And more intuitive than pins.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
On the other hand, they are specific to a particular phone on a particular screen.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Right?

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Different phones have different screen layouts.

24:29.000 --> 24:35.000
Even when they show you a numeric pad, they often show you it in a different way.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
There was no standardization.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
So, it was difficult to assure that the same, if you wanted to use the same unlock pattern

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
on multiple devices, you might not be able to do it.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Um, then the screen smudges.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
I think I mentioned it earlier.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I did.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
So, your fingertips have oils on them, normal.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Right?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
It's not sweat or anything.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
Like, even a dry looking finger will have some oil on them.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Right?

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
And, um, it will leave smudges on the screen.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
Well, besides being annoying, meaning you have to clean the screen, it also leaves residue.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
And that residue can be used to deduce the thing.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
If somebody, like, looks at your phone, even without you being there, and just, like,

25:20.000 --> 25:33.000
takes a high-dress photo of the screen, they might be able to deduce at least parts of these finger movements that you made to unlock.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
It also turns out that there's acoustic leakage.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
Remember I mentioned about acoustic emanations from keyboards when you type in a password?

25:42.000 --> 25:49.000
Well, the same, to a lesser extent, but the same is true of, uh, dragging your fingertips across the screen.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
You make a noise.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
You might not hear it very well, but there is a noise being made.

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
Because even though the screen is glass, right, there's still friction.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
And friction makes noise.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
Um, it is also more susceptible to shoulder surfing.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And so the question is why?

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
So think, remember shoulder surfing?

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
I stand kind of behind you and kind of like, oh, look at what you're doing on the screen.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
And typically against passwords, right?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Or pins.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
But this, the claim is, is more susceptible to shoulder surfing apart.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Why do you think?

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
Visual products are easy to remember.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
You don't even need to look at how he moved the finger.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
You only need to see how he moved the head.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Maybe some people can guess.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Yeah, yeah, true.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
But basically, the main reason what she said is that visual patterns are just easier to memorize.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Okay?

26:55.000 --> 27:05.000
Now, if you have a camera, like, looking down on somebody's, like, for example, if there's a camera here and it's like looking at all your screens,

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
uh, there's no big difference between pins and unlock patterns.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
But if it's a human, definitely easier to remember and unlock that.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Also, it proudly displays the whole pattern.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
It does!

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
It does!

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
It does!

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Which is weird, right?

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
In fact, I always wondered why it doesn't erase the tail.

27:24.000 --> 27:34.000
You know how you type a password and it will, like, linger, every character will linger for, like, a second and then it will be replaced by an asterisk or something?

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
So the whole password is not displayed when you type it, obviously.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Why even do the same for unlock patterns?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
It should be, like, a comment, right?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Like, erasing its own tail.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
But they don't.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
In the end, the entire pattern is visible.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
True.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
You had a question.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
What?

27:52.000 --> 28:01.000
Yeah, uh, back in the day, like, 2013, when Android all was, first off, popular, and screen-in-locks were all happening,

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
when you were setting up your phone, you had the option of, like, screen-in-lock, pin, password,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
and they were all prominently really displayed.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Yeah.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
Nowadays, if you get a new Android, it isn't hidden.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Like, you have to actually dig...

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
So you think, you're saying it exists?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Oh, it still exists, yeah.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Oh, it still exists, yeah.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
My brother still uses it.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
You get the new phone number if you want.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Okay, but when I asked...

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
What?

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
Must be working for a phone number.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
But still, right?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Nobody's using it today.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
No, it's hidden.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
No, no, but all of you, okay?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Nobody's using it, right?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Okay, interesting.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Okay, you had a question.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
What's up?

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
I was gonna say the tail disappeared in some of them.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
In some of them it does?

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Okay, well, hallelujah.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Good.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
That would make more sense.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
And also, the last but not least, people do tend to pick predictable patterns.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
That's also been studied.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Yeah, you're not gonna pick some kind of a funny curly cue, right?

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
Usually it's kind of like a very predictable rectangular, triangular pattern.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
All right, so what can we do to strengthen passwords?

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
Well, I mean, passwords themselves, we already kind of reached the limit, right?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
There's no way...

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Okay, humans are literate today.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
We all can...

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Because we use electronics, even those of us who don't go to...

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Don't finish high school, right?

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
There are people in the world, lots of people in the world who don't finish high school

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
or get barely elementary school education.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
They still don't.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Numbers, right?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
They know letters.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
So literacy is good, reasonably good, better than it was 50 years ago or 100 years ago.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
But memorization is a problem, right?

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
So already memorizing 12 character passwords or 12 position passwords is difficult, right?

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
Assuming we even mix in special characters, numbers, lowercase, uppercase, et cetera.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
So we've kind of reached the limit, right?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
The humans are not going to develop beyond this.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
And so all of a sudden, the next generation is going to be remembering 20 character passwords.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Not going to happen.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Okay?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
So what can we do?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Well, we can add biometrics.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
That's kind of an easy answer, right?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Add biometrics.

30:06.000 --> 30:14.000
And so, for example, I have fingerprints, ivory scans, dynamic biometrics like keystrokes, right?

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Voice prints, et cetera.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
But, and we'll talk about biometrics in more detail.

30:19.000 --> 30:25.000
But the biggest problem with biometrics is revocation.

30:25.000 --> 30:34.000
Meaning if somebody, you know, if somebody's fingerprints were hijacked or somebody's keyboard patterns can be replicated, right?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
By a pod.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
How do you revolve it?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Right?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
How do you stop it?

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Because biometric is not something that can change, right?

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
You're not going to suddenly change the way you type.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
You cannot change your DNA.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Right?

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
We have genomic-based authentication.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
You cannot change your irises.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Certainly you don't want to change your, you can change your fingerprints, but why?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Let him out.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
I hope there's not a toilet here.

30:59.000 --> 31:13.000
Sometimes they put on, do unfortunate things like a bread bowl, there's a staff room with like coffee.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
And when you're there, it's next to it, on the other side of the wall is a toilet.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
So, every time somebody flushes, even if it unrolls toilet paper, you hear it, it's like, why?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Why did they do this?

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
I mean, it's really not pleasant.

31:26.000 --> 31:34.000
So, anyway, so the other possibility, so we'll talk about biometrics, but the other possibility is graphical passwords.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Like image-based passwords.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Okay?

31:37.000 --> 31:43.000
And so, maybe you have to strengthen things, right?

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
So, one example is what's called image recognition.

31:47.000 --> 32:00.000
Because the idea is that we humans are kind of better, like this used to be much more true before than it is today, but we are generally better at recognizing images than bots or than computer programs.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Right?

32:02.000 --> 32:16.000
So, one possibility is to say, okay, let's say the user's password or equivalent of a password is a sequence of images.

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
Or a set, nothing in the sequence, a set of images.

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
And there are many images we can show the user, but the user has to pick the right set.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
You kind of know what I'm saying?

32:31.000 --> 32:44.000
So, instead of memorizing something explicit to enter, you are asked to select a set of images that essentially are your passwords.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
But you are selecting them from a large set.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Okay?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
A large enough set.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Right?

32:52.000 --> 33:02.000
And so, the idea is that, you know, yeah, you might think authenticity is similar to showing you a pinpad and you selecting the right digits.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
But you have to remember those digits.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
But you have to remember those digits where with images you are recognizing.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Right?

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Rather remember you are recognizing.

33:09.000 --> 33:25.000
So, the motivation behind this is that it's difficult to mount dictionary attack on images.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Right?

33:26.000 --> 33:34.000
Because they don't follow the same pattern as, let's say, human memory does when we're selecting, or human mind does when selecting passwords of him.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Okay?

33:35.000 --> 33:44.000
Of course, images are not random, but some people like to believe they are.

33:44.000 --> 33:50.000
The one problem with images right away, if you use images for authentication, is that you cannot use very simple devices.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Right?

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
Something like a smartphone is going to be a challenge.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Right?

33:56.000 --> 34:09.000
So, this is already not particularly good for, like, limited real estate devices.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
But for a tablet or a laptop, this is probably okay.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Right?

34:13.000 --> 34:20.000
So, let's think about, like, how would you use a graphical password on a tablet, laptop, desktop type of device.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Alright?

34:21.000 --> 34:31.000
Also, we need to think about shoulder surfing, because when somebody picks images, right, those picks are kind of visible, right?

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Obviously, right?

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
Because they have to, like, click on them or somehow select them.

34:35.000 --> 34:41.000
Well, wouldn't displaying images reveal information because you know one of the images you selected at least has to be there?

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
And so, if you just try to log in...

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Right, right, right.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Okay, okay.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
So, let me give you a general idea.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Let me give you a general idea.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
I mean, we'll go in this video.

34:48.000 --> 34:59.000
So, suppose I display to you on your laptop screen 12 images at a time.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
One of them means something to you.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
The others don't.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
You pick one.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
I display a second screen, 12 images.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
One of them means something to you.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
The others don't.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Click.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
I display the third, the fourth.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
So, that's what we do four times.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Right.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
But if you need to have, like, hundreds of thousands of these images to be secured, then...

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Well, no, no, no.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Not secured.

35:25.000 --> 35:31.000
The point is that the equivalent of a password here would be the combination, the exact combination.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
The one from the first screen, one from the second screen.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Okay.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
So, how many?

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Well, there is like 12 to the power of four, right?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
10,000.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Combinations.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
Just repeat it over and over again.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Like, remove the...

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Regenerate the...

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
No, no, no.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
See, the idea is that there always has to be an image that is...

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Exactly.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Yeah, exactly.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Yeah.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Which one that repeats?

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Which one is always there, right?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Okay.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
You're going way ahead.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Right.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
You're getting ahead.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Exactly.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Exactly.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
So, now I'm just starting to think, like, paranoia, right?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
A little bit of suspicion.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
That's how security people do.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
But the idea was like this.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
I'm just telling you this because this is what people try to replace password, replace password.

36:14.000 --> 36:22.000
And the moral of the story at the end, which I'm going to jump to anyway, is passwords are here to stay for a reason.

36:22.000 --> 36:28.000
Because not for the lack of trying to replace them with something.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
So, here's an example.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
It's called past faces.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
And at one point, it was like a really popular thing.

36:35.000 --> 36:41.000
And so, and from this quote, you can see where it's going.

36:41.000 --> 36:48.000
It's a beautiful solution, but it's completely wrong.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
And so, this is like the pitch.

36:50.000 --> 36:56.000
The pitch is, you are really good, you humans, you know, are really good at recognizing faces.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Right?

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
They really mean something to you.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
It's really like a decision problem, right?

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
So, you know, in computational complexity, there are computation problems and decision problems.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Yeah?

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
Remember this from complexity or algorithms?

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000
Well, recognition is a decision problem that your brain goes through.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
Do I know this space or do I not know this space?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Okay?

37:23.000 --> 37:32.000
So, a password is a computation problem, meaning that you have to fetch it from the storage somewhere in your brain.

37:32.000 --> 37:39.000
Whereas that recognition is a decision problem.

37:39.000 --> 37:47.000
So, for us, clearly, this is absolutely true, that it's easier to recognize a face than to remember a password.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Okay?

37:48.000 --> 37:56.000
Of course, let's forget for a second, people with severe eyesight issues or blind people.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Okay?

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
That's not, of course, universal.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Okay?

38:02.000 --> 38:12.000
But then passwords for people with no hands or, you know, malformed fingers are also different.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
So, again, this is like a marketing pitch.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Never forget a face.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Alright?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
So, let's skip to this.

38:19.000 --> 38:33.000
So, the idea is a user will be enrolled into a system that will show them, like a training exercise, a set of faces.

38:33.000 --> 38:40.000
And they will be assigned a set of, let's say, six faces and repeatedly trained on recognizing those faces.

38:40.000 --> 38:52.000
Presumably within some time limit, like 30 minutes, 20 minutes, they will be given exercises to recognize those five, six faces that they're assigned to them.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Yeah?

38:53.000 --> 39:08.000
Then, after enrollment, whenever they want to log in, they will be shown sequences of these kind of vignettes, like 12 at a time, 10 at a time, and ask to pick a face that is one of theirs.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Okay?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
That's the main idea.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Okay?

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
So, you have a library, but you must have, of course, a big library of faces.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
But that's easy, right?

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
You just collect, it's easy to collect a big library of black faces.

39:26.000 --> 39:35.000
You can have different ages, genders, facial growth, hairstyles, all kinds of people, different races.

39:35.000 --> 39:42.000
And then, there is a user interface, where users are initially assigned, in this example, five faces.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Okay?

39:44.000 --> 39:53.000
And, each of the five faces is associated with decoys, right?

39:53.000 --> 40:02.000
So, when you're trained, you see the blonde, over there, with bangs, that's your face.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
This guy, smiling guy, over there in the middle is your face.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
This lady is your face, et cetera, et cetera.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
So, these are five faces that are supposed to be for you to remember.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Okay?

40:15.000 --> 40:24.000
And now, every time you log in, you are shown a sequence of this, and this, and this, and this, and this.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
And you must select, and maybe, maybe this is a different order, maybe in a different order.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
The order doesn't matter.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
The order could be perturbed.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Right?

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
You can show this first, and that, and this.

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
The thing is, you remember, you're supposed to remember the faces that are associated with you.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
So, it's the same set of eight faces at the time.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
Now, it's the same set of eight, but this might appear here.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Right?

40:48.000 --> 40:55.000
So, the order of these five screens would change.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Right?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
This can be random.

40:57.000 --> 41:04.000
And the placement of your face within each screen will change too.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Okay?

41:05.000 --> 41:12.000
So, on a given screen that you're shown with, in this case, nine faces, one of them is yours.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
Its position is random.

41:15.000 --> 41:25.000
So, this is the original enrollment, familiarization process, blah, blah, blah.

41:25.000 --> 41:33.000
And so, the claim is that once you memorize, it's like there's a cookie in your brain.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
Like a web cookie, you know, browser cookie.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
That helps you recognize that.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
And maybe, indeed, that's how the brain works.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
I mean, like we, I think there's actually a cookie, but there is something, some state information

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
that's stored in your brain.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
It's like when you see the same, like, character actor in the movie, in several movies.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Right?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
You kind of recognize them again.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You might not remember their face.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Sorry.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
You might not remember their name.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Right?

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Because, you know, many character actors, but you recognize them.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
So, this is what's called cognometrics.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Right?

42:06.000 --> 42:17.000
Biometrics is cognometrics, because you're not using any innate property of yourself as a human.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
You're using your recognition capabilities.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
And this was, believe it or not, this was really popular for a while.

42:25.000 --> 42:30.000
It really, like, the company that came up with it, they were, like, riding super hot.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
It was one of those unicorn stars.

42:32.000 --> 42:39.000
So, there's two variations, and you can think already which one is better.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
There's variations where the system assigns you faces, like the one you just saw.

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
And there's another variation where the user picks faces.

42:49.000 --> 42:55.000
Like, you're given, like, a vignette of, like, nine, and you say, I like this face.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
And another vignette of nine, and you pick another face.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Okay?

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
Now, presumably, a user will pick faces they can remember better, right?

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
So, there's less training.

43:09.000 --> 43:16.000
Now, a third possibility you can imagine where the user uploads their own faces.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
Now, they didn't know for this.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
Anybody can see why?

43:22.000 --> 43:27.000
Because if somebody mounts an attack, a dictionary attack, right?

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Or, sort of, an attack on somebody's fast pace.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
And they know that the system allows them to upload their own photos.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
Well, they're probably likely to know who are your friends, relatives, etc.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Right?

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Right?

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
So, do you have treatment?

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
So, that's why that was not offered, right?

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Where a user uploads their own photos.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Also, by highlighting.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
That is also true, right?

43:49.000 --> 43:56.000
So, yeah, of course, you can deal with that by varying lighting and so on, and, you know, reducing green light, increasing green light.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
But, they didn't offer that.

43:58.000 --> 44:06.000
Then, a bunch of people at, some researchers at John Plotkin's, and CMU, did a study of this.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
And, this is, which brought the whole house and cars down.

44:09.000 --> 44:14.000
They studied the user-selected fast pace variant.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
Because, the system-selected one turned out not to be very practical.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
People were just forgetting faces.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Right?

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
The user-selected one worked better.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
When I say user-selected, it's the second one.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Right?

44:28.000 --> 44:39.000
The conclusion was, that people tend to pick very biased faces.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Right?

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
The race and gender, or ethnicity and gender, have a lot to do with it.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
Is that any of the surprising?

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
That's how we are.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
That's how we operate.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Right?

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
And, particularly, it was, it was particularly bad for male students.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
But, they didn't experiment on students.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
So, keep that in mind, it's a specific preparation.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Right?

45:05.000 --> 45:14.000
So, meaning two guesses of faces were enough for most, sorry, for 10% of male users, and eight guesses were enough for a quarter.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
To basically get their fast faces.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
Because, they would just pick, I don't know, the prettiest girls.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
And, in fact, yeah?

45:23.000 --> 45:29.000
Then, why not show all the particular in the same row, and then choose the only one level?

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Because, they were simply not enough.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Right?

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
You have to mix in others.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Yeah.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
But, I mean, I actually don't know the reasoning.

45:36.000 --> 45:42.000
But, they would always consist, I mean, they tended to pick a very predictable kind of a face.

45:42.000 --> 45:59.000
So, in the end, the system should probably pick, for security purposes, it's better for the system to pick faces for users than for users to pick faces.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
Because, users will always exercise some bias, depending on their characteristics.

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
But, if the system picks faces, then you have a high error rate, and that's what they've observed.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
Also, some people have what is called dyspagia.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
It's a condition where they are unable to recognize faces.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
There's a small percentage of humans all over the world that have this condition.

46:22.000 --> 46:31.000
There is a book by a neuroscientist called, A Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
And, he talks about, you know, patients that have that issue.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
How's it?

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
Personal technology.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Personal technology.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Personal, okay.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
There you go.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Personal technology.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
It's rare, but it's not completely unknown.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Also, you need these displays.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
So, this is not good enough for smartphones.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
It was supposed to be good enough for, like, laptops, desks.

46:53.000 --> 47:01.000
And also, last but not least, changing a set of faces is really hard.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
It's harder than past ones.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Okay?

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
It really is hard.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
Now, think about why this is.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
This was also studied.

47:06.000 --> 47:17.000
Because, all these, you know, like, old faces, they're still here.

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
So, you cannot erase the cookies from your brain.

47:22.000 --> 47:28.000
The past faces that, say, you used in last year, are still in your brain.

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
And, when you change, on January 1st, a new set of past faces, you will have a really hard

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
time remembering which ones are from each.

47:36.000 --> 47:45.000
So, that was like, I think, a final nail in the coffin of this method.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Now, shoulder surfing.

47:47.000 --> 47:54.000
Generally, graphical passwords, as are unlocked patterns, are more vulnerable to shoulder surfing.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Okay?

47:55.000 --> 48:06.000
Because, selecting pictures, right, recognizable pictures, is just more visible.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
And, also, it takes time, right?

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
So, with a password, if you do remember the password, it doesn't take the past.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
It didn't take the past.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
The recognition takes longer.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
Because, you're going to see, let's say, in the example I showed, you'll see a small,

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
I mean, a screen with nine photos.

48:25.000 --> 48:32.000
And, the position of the person's face, that is part of your past face, password, is going

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
to change.

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
So, your eyes have to go around, like, and find that face.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
That takes longer, and that means it's easier to shoulder surfing.

48:41.000 --> 48:48.000
So, there was an experiment done, a shoulder surfing experiment at the University of Maryland,

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
in Baltimore County, where people were using two types of passwords.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Pass faces with a mouse.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
That's saying pass faces with a mouse.

48:56.000 --> 49:02.000
Mouse means, yeah, you mouse over the face that you recognize, click.

49:02.000 --> 49:09.000
Then, there's pass faces with a keyboard, where you basically use the arrow keys to move.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
Dictionary text passwords is a normal password.

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
Non-dictionary text passwords with random words and numbers.

49:17.000 --> 49:22.000
And, the result was, actually, non-dictionary text passwords was the worst.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
That is, the best for shoulder surfing, but the worst for the users.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
And, maybe you can tell me why that is.

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
Because, when you're typing non-dictionary text, you're kind of typed slower, because it's not a word, and...

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
It's not a word, and it's like...

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Getting your fingers moving in really weird ways.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
That's right.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
So, that really is the only reason.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
The only reason.

49:47.000 --> 49:57.000
Now, one of the things that has been used, one of the techniques that has been used for pin entry,

49:57.000 --> 50:04.000
that has been relatively successful, but it's really terrible for shoulder surfing, is this.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Maybe some of you have encountered it.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Yeah.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
So, normally, you enter a pin by just typing in the number, right?

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
Anybody's ever seen other ways of entering a pin?

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
Okay, so...

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Let me see if I...

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I'm not sure what you're saying, but like...

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
Instead of being one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
Oh, oh, oh, right.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Scramble keypad, right?

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
Scramble keypad.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Okay.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Yeah.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
On the screen.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
On the screen.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
On the screen.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
On the screen.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Yes, I've seen those.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Not recently.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Does anybody see why?

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Well, it slows you down.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Which is really bad for shoulder surfing.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
But why do they do it?

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
Well, I guess that fixes the smudging problem.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Well, there's no smudging because you're typing, right?

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
So, they're clicking.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
I think it's protecting for maybe some other app in your own phone.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Yes.

50:51.000 --> 51:00.000
It's trying to protect from somebody, like, looking which part of the screen you type.

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
So, if there's some malicious program, whether it's on a smartphone or an air or an computer,

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
it's trying to protect from somebody, like, looking which part of the screen you type.

51:05.000 --> 51:20.000
So, if there's some malicious program, whether it's on a smartphone or an air or a computer,

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
it's looking what part of the screen was clicked, they won't know.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
They won't know, right?

51:26.000 --> 51:31.000
We will know if the layout of the pin path is constant.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
But if it varies, they won't know, right?

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
But the way that I was talking about is different.

51:36.000 --> 51:45.000
Suppose that instead of entering the pin, what you have to do is use arrow keys to adjust a random number to your pin.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
Has anybody seen that?

51:49.000 --> 51:58.000
So, you're displaying a pin, which is some, let's say it's four digits, right?

51:58.000 --> 52:04.000
You're displaying a 7, 9, 2, 5.

52:04.000 --> 52:13.000
And your pin is actually 8, 1, 3, 7.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Right?

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
This is your pin.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
But the number you see on the screen is this.

52:19.000 --> 52:27.000
So, what you do is you use an arrow key once, then you sideways arrow key, right?

52:27.000 --> 52:43.000
Sideways arrow key, then down 8, 8 clicks down, sideways, 1 click up, sideways, 2 clicks up.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
Do you follow what I'm saying?

52:46.000 --> 52:54.000
You essentially take a random number and adjust it to your pin.

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
Really terrible for shoulder surfing, because at the end of this, what will be displayed?

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Your pin.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
Right?

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
Because you're adjusting a random number to the pin, yes?

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
But what is it good for?

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
The entry is never the same.

53:11.000 --> 53:27.000
The entry is never the same, and if there's a keyboard sniffer, a key logger, or a person in another room with a microphone listening to the clicks, what are they going to hear?

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
Different sequence.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Different sequence every time.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
Different sequence.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
Different sequence every time.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
Don't make yourself puzzled.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Look at, look, look.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
It's really an excellent method when somebody cannot look at your screen.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Right?

53:42.000 --> 54:03.000
If the adversary is eavesdropping acoustically, or the adversary is recording the keystrokes, like because they planted some malicious driver on their keyboard, or some app that gets privileges to actually record the keystrokes, this method is excellent.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
The problem is, it does display your pin in the end.

54:08.000 --> 54:13.000
So if somebody is also looking at the screen, it does.

54:13.000 --> 54:23.000
Right, so, if you want to read more about it, there's a nice article titled, Why Are We All Such Idiots?

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
And it tells you about password ticks.

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
This is Maurice, well, Maurice, like nine years old.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
Now, let's look at biometrics for a sec.

54:35.000 --> 54:41.000
Biometric authentication is, on the surface, kind of nice.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
There's nothing to remember.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
Absolutely nothing to remember with biometrics.

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
I mean, other than like, this is my finger, this is my face.

54:51.000 --> 54:57.000
So, as long as you remember where your face is and where your fingers are, you're okay.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
There's nothing to compute, generally, right?

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
With biometrics.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
There's no device to carry around for you, right?

55:06.000 --> 55:13.000
Now, okay, yes, phone is a device you do carry around, but in prior time, right?

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Phones are not an issue, right?

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
If you wanted to get access to a system, right?

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
A mainframe computer or network, or enter a building, and it was protected by biometrics,

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
there's nothing you need to carry around, right?

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
Today, if the phone is what you want to get into, and you use a biometrics,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
you don't have to carry around anything additional.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
All right.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
Biometrics cannot be shared.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
That's the other problem.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
A lot of people who share passwords.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Like, let's say, all the streaming sites, right?

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
How many of you share passwords on your streaming site?

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
I bet all of you do, right?

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
I mean, I personally mooch off my kids, you know?

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
I mean, I paid enough for them, now they can pay for my streaming pleasures.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
So, yeah, we share pins, we share passwords.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
If we need to have biometrics, you cannot share, right?

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
You can't, right?

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
It's just fundamentally shouldn't be possible.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Which is good, right?

56:13.000 --> 56:19.000
So, imagine, I'm not hoping this will happen, but I wouldn't be surprised if next year Netflix

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
says, oh, you know, you want to use your Netflix account?

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
Well, stick your eyes in here, or come close to the camera, or like, you know,

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
look at your face, or face unlock with your phone, and it will give you a code, right?

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
So, something like that.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
Can be pretty unique, right?

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
It's not always unique.

56:40.000 --> 56:46.000
Not all biometrics are good enough, but, and they do vary quite a bit, but generally, they

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
can be made sufficiently accurate.

56:50.000 --> 56:56.000
But the problems right away with biometrics is that they offer two things.

56:56.000 --> 57:03.000
One is identification, which is associating an identity, right, with some action or data,

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
right?

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
Like a, like forensically finding a fingerprint in a crime scene, right?

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
That's identifying a criminal, right?

57:11.000 --> 57:18.000
And authentication is verifying an identity, like verifying that you are here right now.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
Do you see the difference?

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
Verification of live identity, right?

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
You are here right now.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
Like when your phone looks at your face, right?

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
It's like, you are here right now.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
Not you were here before, right?

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
But you are here right now.

57:37.000 --> 57:42.000
That's authentication.

57:42.000 --> 57:50.000
The difficulty of forgery is difficult to estimate, because it varies from biometric to biometric.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
But it's usually overestimate.

57:53.000 --> 57:58.000
There are computer generated forgeries.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
There are also, with 3D printers, things become very interesting.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
For example, fingerprints, right?

58:05.000 --> 58:15.000
You can actually take somebody's fingerprint and easily, well, if you have access to a 3D printer, print a finger.

58:15.000 --> 58:27.000
Just a disconnected thing that has a cushiony, human-like skin-cut feel, and perfectly replicates everything in the finger.

58:27.000 --> 58:36.000
I mean, in the same way, you could also print somebody's face in 3D.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
What is difficult to do in 3D is to make it live.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
And you have it moving, right?

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
Have the lips moving, nose moving, et cetera.

58:45.000 --> 58:53.000
But just to print the face, and that would fool some of the, maybe not current, but earlier face recognition.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Unlocks it.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
It's totally doable.

58:55.000 --> 59:00.000
And it's been demonstrated.

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
As I said before, revocation of biometrics is really hard.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
And you need an infrastructure.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Right?

59:08.000 --> 59:15.000
If you have a biometric based authentication in a company, let's say, on a company brand.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
Anybody ever work for a company that uses biometrics?

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
No?

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Hmm.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Thank you.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
There's somebody else.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
You did?

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
No.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
What kind of admin?

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
We did fingerprints.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Fingerprints.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Well, so, that means readers, right?

59:29.000 --> 59:40.000
So, it wasn't like you could come to the badge reader at the door of the company, put your phone there, and then unlock your phone, and it will let you know.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
Right?

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
So, my guess is you have to put your finger on their fingerprint reader, right?

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
And so, every door had to be protected through the fingerprint.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
That implies infrastructure.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Right?

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
It also implies enrollment.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:03.000
And enrollment is what all of you go through when you do the first, when you get a new phone and you do the face unlock enrollment or fingerprint enrollment.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Now, face unlock enrollment is not that difficult, right?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
How long does it take for you?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Give me an info card.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
That's reasonably fast.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Anybody who took long?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
A minute.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
A minute.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Okay.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So, let's say a minute.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
It's not a big deal these days, right?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Anybody remember doing fingerprint enrollment?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
That took a long time.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
It's annoying.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Right?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Because sometimes it will not take your finger because you're going to put it the right way, right?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
That was very annoying.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I mean, my previous phone had fingerprint enrollment.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And also, well, I had high error rates.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
If my finger was wet, it wouldn't work.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
If my finger was dry, very dry, I had chalk on it, it wouldn't work.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
So, it was okay.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Faces are better.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Anyway, but the point here is you need infrastructure, right?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
So, forget, here we're used to this, right?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Unlocking this.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
This is easy.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
There's not a lot of infrastructure other than the camera to do face unlock.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Right?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And some software, some fancy software that actually supports it.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Right?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
For fingerprint, the same even less, right?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Well, now they don't even have to.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But, if you want to do it on an enterprise-wide basis, that's an expensive investment.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
You need to actually have all the device input devices, right?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
For people through or for fingerprint.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Right?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It must have all these other programs.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
This is more formal.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Right?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
You need to consider using biometrics.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
It has to be universal.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Right?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
It has to be usable by most people.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
So, if you suggest a biometric that only works for people with white skin, that isn't

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
good.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Or, if you suggest a biometric that only is usable for people who are right-handed, that's

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
not going to work.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Right?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Now, if you say, well, sorry, my biometric does not work for mute people.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Okay, it's not nice, but it's probably reasonably acceptable.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So, you have to make sure it's as universal as possible.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Unique.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
There must be sufficient degree of distinction.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
So, one biometric that has been proposed in the past is gait.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Gait is the way you walk.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Okay?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Turns out, most people walk in a very particular way.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Is it unique?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
No.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000
There's other problems, but among other things, it's not unique.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Permanence.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
This is consistency over time.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Does the biometric stay the same, or does it change?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
For example, your genome stays the same.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Does your face stay the same?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Hmm?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Hmm?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Hmm?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Hmm?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Hmm?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Hmm?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Not certain, right?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Not certain.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
What about your fingerprints?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Yeah, your fingerprints stay the same as long as you don't cut them off or, you know,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
have a certain skin condition.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Eczema.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.000
But otherwise, the generally stays the same.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Unobtrusiveness.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Does it disrupt the normal flow?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Well, if you tell me that before I enter the building I need to walk three times like

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
this in front of the door, there's going to be a large queue and I'm going to be very annoying.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
So, it's definitely obtrusive, right?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
So, unobtrusiveness is fine, right?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Maybe a fingerprint is not very obtrusive.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
A face is reasonably not very obtrusive, right?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
You're used to it now with TSA, right?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
When you go to the airport.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Increasingly, they're starting to use face recognition.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Right?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
They don't even ask you, some of the places don't even ask you for a boarding pass anymore.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Have you seen that?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I've encountered several times in the last six to eight months.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And they don't ask you for a boarding pass.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
You just do a face recognition piece.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Circumvention difficulty.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
It should be hard to impersonate others, but that relates to uniqueness.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Equipment cost, right?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It cannot cost an arm in a lab.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
And easy enrollment things.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Or how difficult it is to enroll people in that boundary.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Enrolling people in something like a handwriting biometric.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Right?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Where they recognize your handwriting, but that's pretty time-fixing.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Enrolling in face biometrics, as you said, is not difficult.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:47.000
There is in biometrics something called fraud rate, or basically a false positive.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Everybody familiar, I'm sure, with fraud positive?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Right?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And the insult rate.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Yeah.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
That's an old term.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
It means a false negative.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Right?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
False negative means the system says, yeah, go away.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I don't know you.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Right?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
That's an insult.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Right?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
To the customer, right?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
That's a false insult to me.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So, some companies that use biometrics, like banks, they're very, very concerned about insults.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Right?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Because they want to piss off the customer.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
The government doesn't care.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
They don't care about the insult.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Right?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So, fraud rate is false positive.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Right?

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
That is, how can you, the circumvention of biometrics, how is it to circumvent?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
In some cases, how is it to mistakenly not recognize somebody?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Right?

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
So, usually they are like interdependent, like a seesaw.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
We increase one, the other one goes down, and the other way around.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000
For face recognition, today, this has been a big, a big jump in efficacy.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
But today, the error rates tend to be around 1% for face recognition.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That's for the best face recognition algorithms today.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Or just even under 1%.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And this is down from like 5% 10 years ago, and 20% 15 years ago.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
So, there's been some amazing progress in face recognition.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Doesn't mean that's going to be your experience with your smartphone.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Because you're not running the fastest, the most advanced face recognition.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Just because your smartphone isn't capable of doing, you know, that much computation.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
But, have you noticed that over time, the face recognition improved?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Especially with iPhones.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I mean, I'm not a fan of iPhones, but I found that iPhone face recognition is pretty good.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Like, I rarely have issues.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Whereas before, when I used the early Android face recognition, it was terrible.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Any kind of shadow, any kind of a hat, anything like that would throw it off.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
And fingerprints were just horrific.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
They were super annoying.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000
But fingerprints have been around for a long time.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Oh, sorry.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000
If you use weak hardware, like if you use IoT devices that use face recognition,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
then the error rates will go up to like 40 or so.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
So that's not very good.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Also, consider this.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Injuries, right?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
You have a, you know, you run into a wall or something.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
So, you know, you get into a fight, you know, part of your face like swells up.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
That influences face recognition a lot.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Hair, shouldn't, right?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
The really good algorithms, they don't, facial hair does not sway them,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
but the cheaper algorithms, the faster algorithms do.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Medicines, drugs that alter, sometimes you'll have like bags under your eyes

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:55.000
or any kind of like things that, side effects of illegal drugs or just regular pharmaceutical medicine.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Plastic surgery clearly will alter your face, right?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:07.000
So that's even something like a small nose job or a, what do you call it?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Lip injections can cause lack of recognition.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Acne, your acne will also cause problems.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
So facial recognition has still some challenges.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Now, fingerprints were really popular before, right?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
They've been used since like actually 19th century.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.000
They were sort of, the whole process started in criminology in France, I think, in the 19th century.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
But the US, the first conviction was in 1911 based on fingerprint evidence.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
So there's a lot of science behind using fingerprints.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I mean, they're used today for crime scenes, identification, right, et cetera.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
They're reasonably unique, right?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
If you get an actual fingerprint, right, a full fingerprint, they're really unique.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
The probability of collision is like 1 in 10 billion, maybe even less today.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
The problem is, well, generally fingerprints don't change, right?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Unlike with the face, they don't change with time, right?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So a child's fingerprint is still going to have the same patterns and the same person when they are an adult.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
The finger size, the fingertip size will grow, but the patterns will stay.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:31.000
So it will grow proportionally, which means that modern fingerprint algorithms can accommodate, let's say, a teenager or a tween,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000
who are still going to grow, but the algorithm will still recognize their finger.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:43.000
But eczema and, you know, scars and missing fingers, of course, indeed, lead up.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I think we are, oh, time to be done, yeah?

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Yeah?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Is that 1 in 10 billion genetically, or...?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
No, no, no, no.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I think genetically you are, I mean, in the analog world, you are unique when it's actually a fingerprint.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Now, I'm not speaking from, like, real knowledge here, but I remember reading something that, you know, you are unique, but the problem is the accuracy of it.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Taking the fingerprints, right?

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
That's why it's only 10 billion.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
You should be good at it.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Okay.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.000
So, again, if you have not sent me your project proposal, you need to do it to our SAP.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
If I don't get it by the end of the day, you will lose points.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
So, please get on the ball.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Let's just stick down the ball.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:41.000
.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
.
