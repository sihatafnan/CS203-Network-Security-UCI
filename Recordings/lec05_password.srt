1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
later in the course. That is, there was a back-end SQL database, very large database, that was somehow accessible via external web server.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Anyway, you see the pointers here, you can still read about these.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That is just a nice playground to analyze, and here are some statistics, some takeaways from that database.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:44,000
These are top 20 passwords, and what you see is the rank, the password, and the number of users that selected that password.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Some of those are totally not surprising, right? Like ABC 1-3, 1-8, 1-7, Roku, because it's a Roku database.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Princess, I don't know, I can't explain princess, I don't know what that's about, but I love you, password, okay, those are easy to explain.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Monkey, I don't know, that must be a term of endearment in the UK, but then we'll be fine here.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Names, mostly female names for some reason, okay, maybe that's because most of the users were male.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is the gaming side of it, so it's fair to prove the majority of the users were male.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Right, so that's kind of depressing.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now, we'll come back to passwords later, but one of the things I want to illustrate is that sometimes companies, websites, and organizations come up with clever tricks to make it easy for users to pick passwords or pick and memorize pins.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now, in this case, banks typically use pins, right?

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
For website access, they use password, but for ATM access, right, they use pins.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Also, on the phone, they often ask you, if you call a bank, they'll ask you for a pin.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And so, if you let users pick pins, you'll have the same problems as with passwords.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Users will pick dates, typically, right?

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Or some kind of very familiar, predictable things like, I don't know, a street address or a phone number, right?

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, dates, street addresses, phone numbers are the most common choices for pins if you leave users the freedom to pick them.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So, this bank in the UK wanted to make it easy for users to memorize their pins.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But the pins were supposed to be random, okay?

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Meaning, the bank would come up with a random pin and assign it to the user.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Are you with me?

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Alright.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This happens here, too, even today, right?

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Some banks do that.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Definitely, my bank did it about 10 years ago, and they stopped.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So, what they said is like this.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you basically get a grid, like this, you see, a 4 by 10 grid.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And the top row is the numbers, right?

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So, if the bank gives you a password, sorry, a pin that is 4 digits,

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you basically pick your favorite 4 character word that you know you will remember,

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and write it down from left to right on this grid.

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, in this example, the bank gave the password, sorry, a pin 2256.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's presumably a randomly generated pin.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And the user happens to write the word blue, because 4 digits, right?

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
4 characters, blue.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So, if the user writes the word blue on this grid, where that 22, right?

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because BL are under 2, because that means the first characters,

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the first digits should be 2 and 2.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And then UE, 5, 6, right?

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, the idea is that then, once the user has written it down,

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,000
all the other squares in this table are filled in with random characters.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Are you with me?

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now imagine, I wish I had better animation here,

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
imagine the rest of the squares filled with random characters,

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
also written in the same typeface in black, okay?

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, you cannot tell, right?

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And the point of this is that, if you look at this cheat sheet, right?

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You print this out, right?

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You carry this around, this cheat sheet.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It only makes sense to you.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You'll remember your pin, because what you will do,

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
is you'll always remember your word, blue, right?

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Blue is your favorite four-letter word.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So, when somebody else looks at this table,

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and it's filled in with random garbage, right?

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's basically a bunch of letters.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They don't know.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You look puzzled.

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So, normally, in order to guess a pin, a four-digit pin,

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
you would have to try up to, usually half,

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
10,000 possibilities, right?

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There are 10,000 four-digit numbers.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
On average, if you want to break somebody's pin,

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
you would have to try 5,000, right?

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
On average.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But, in this case, if somebody gets a hold of,

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
or takes a snapshot of this table,

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
it might seem like, oh,

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
there's lots of possibilities here, right?

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
At least as many as 10,000, right?

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Because, actually, it's like this.

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Look at that.

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There are four rows that are empty under the number row, right?

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And then there are 10 rows, right?

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Sorry, 10 columns.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So, we have, basically,

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
4 times 4 times 4,

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
4 to the 10th, right?

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Which is 2 to the 20 possibilities

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
of combinations of letters, right?

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Actually, it's more,

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
because you can do the things you can have.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So, it seems like if you look at the combination of letters,

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
it's even more than there are pins.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But the truth is something else.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If somebody takes a snapshot,

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
or steals a copy of this cheat sheet,

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
all they have to do is look for English words,

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
from left to right, right?

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They can go down and sideways,

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
or they can go just sideways, right?

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Human eyes are good at that.

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So, in fact, if you're looking for four-letter English words

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
in a randomly jumbled matrix,

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
where there is really just one four-letter English words,

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
there may be some accidental ones, right?

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You will completely shortcut the pin-breaking process.

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There will be maybe a few dozen possibilities

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
of four-letter English words,

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and one of them will be blue.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So, that's an example of a clever trick

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
that makes it way easier for an adversary to attack the system.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay?

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You still look puzzled.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't believe me?

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Anybody?

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't be afraid to ask.

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Now, remember, it's all left to right, right?

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The digits have to be moving, right?

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There's your pin.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You have to remember your pin as you, the user, the owner,

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
has to remember your pin, right?

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And so, you write a four-letter word,

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
but it's not written like this.

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's written in a certain way, right?

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You have to be able to parse that word, find it.

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You remember the word.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You look at this, you say, you're looking for,

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
if the word is blue, you're looking for the letter B.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then you're looking for L, right?

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Where's L?

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, it's here.

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There's U.

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There's E.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay?

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Now, if you think that standard tricks like,

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't know, spelling words backwards.

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is a typical children's trick, right?

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is the spell.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Some kids even play games with, like, speaking words backwards.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It helps, it does not.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Because the password databases that are out there already have them.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
First and last names, common first and last names.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Most first and last names are just well-known and easy to calculate.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Street names, city names, state names, place names, mountain names.

137
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
All of those things are easily enumerable.

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And all geographical locations in the world, in fact, are.

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Same goes with upper lowercase.

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If you know at least the scope of what users you are trying to have,

141
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
driver's license numbers, right?

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If you know somebody is likely to live in California

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and have a California driver's license number,

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
well, guess what?

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
All California driver's license numbers have a very similar format, right?

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Like my driver's license, C6715402.

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay?

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, there's not a lot of digits there.

149
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I mean, it's enough, but you can enumerate all of them.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
License plates are also in kind of sequential.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
License plates.

152
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In California.

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah.

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, there's that.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
There was a time when even social security numbers had a structure.

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Today, they don't.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But back in my day, you could look at a social security number and say,

158
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
oh, I know which state this comes from.

159
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And I know roughly what year you are going to assign this social security number.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Today, they're not like that.

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay.

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Same goes for telephone numbers.

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Point of language is if you think, oh, well, you know,

164
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm going to use Swahili.

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Meh.

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Most common foreign languages are easily enumerable and stored in these password database.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Probably the best combination, and this is not something I can give you a proof for,

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
is if you don't want to use, let's say, if you're not good at picking things with special symbols

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:35,000
or remembering numbers, the best thing you can do is pick, I would say, three or more languages,

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
three is a good number, that you do not speak.

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay?

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And other people know you don't speak.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Because if people know you speak a particular foreign language, that helps in the attack, right?

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Especially assume that people who will attack you are people who might know something about you.

175
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Like your CV, which is on LinkedIn, might say, I speak Farsi, or I speak Albanian.

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Well, that's a leak.

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Because if you speak Farsi or Albanian, that is a high chance that you will pick a password from those languages.

178
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay?

179
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So what you do is instead pick three languages that you do not speak, but you know a few words.

180
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You don't speak, but you know a few words from each.

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Combine the three words, right?

182
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay?

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And then you have a password.

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That makes it a lot harder for crap.

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It can still be crap, but it's a lot harder.

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay.

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, then, in recent years, most reputable systems started to enforce length limits.

188
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Meaning minimum length for a password, right?

189
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What are the minimum lengths you see out there?

190
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Eight is probably the lower bound, right?

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I haven't seen less than eight for passwords.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
For pins, it can be six, but eight, sometimes 12, right?

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I have not seen more than 12.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Have anybody seen more than 12?

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Right.

196
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Have you seen upper limits?

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, right?

198
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Upper limits exist.

199
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And, yeah, I think we discussed that already, I think, last time, right?

200
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay.

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So, let's say most are today between eight and 12, and then what do they do?

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
They require one upper lower case.

203
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Sorry, let's say, right?

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
One, I guess they require mixed case, right?

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Often, not all.

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Most require at least one letter.

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Sorry, at least one number.

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And if you use all numbers, they require at least one letter, right?

209
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I believe that most people don't do that.

210
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And then one special character, right?

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Which is usually for a minute.

212
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It does not often include like dollar sign or pound sign, right?

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It will be like comma, exclamation, question mark, something like that, right?

214
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And how effective is that, do you think?

215
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I think people would try to use the minimum number of everything and then pattern that they...

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Right.

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That is true.

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The studies have shown that people will use the minimum.

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Studies show that people will use predictable things like, for example, you know, substituting i's with ones.

220
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Substituting o's with zeros.

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Which makes it very, very pretty difficult.

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Adding one, two, three to the beginning or the end.

223
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Adding usually exclamation points.

224
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The typical thing is add one bang or one exclamation point, right?

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Just to satisfy it.

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Just to get rid of the annoying checker, right?

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And let you...

228
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So, yes, it is effective because it increases the search space, but no, not by a lot.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Also, using special characters is an interesting thing.

230
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Now, how many of you have, let's say, logged in using special characters from keyboards other than American keyboards?

231
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Anyone?

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Nobody else?

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Non-quality keyboards, like European keyboards.

234
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Or Asian keyboards.

235
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Just one person.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay.

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Well, I'll raise my hand, too.

238
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So, you know what?

239
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Have you had any difficulties?

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Not usually.

241
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm kind of using the different...

242
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I use it.

243
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Okay.

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Well, one of the things, if you go, let's say, to Europe, is you'll see the keyboards, although

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
they're kind of laid out, the letters are laid out in the same way, the special symbols aren't.

246
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So, like, add sign, pound sign, they're accessible by a different combination than they are in the U.S.

247
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That makes it a real pain.

248
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay?

249
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So, whereas if you constrain your passwords to only letters and numbers, you don't have these issues.

250
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Okay.

251
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, then, what about these guys?

252
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Now, we briefly talked about password vaults and managers, right?

253
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But let's consider them a little more seriously.

254
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
People do use them.

255
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Some companies actually require the use of this.

256
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Okay?

257
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm not going to preach for or against them, but let's consider both sides of these things.

258
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I mean, it's kind of a cottage industry, too, right?

259
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I mean, it's businesses that make money on it.

260
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
As I mentioned before, when we, I think, briefly touched upon it, they have to provide the same level of security

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
that a certification authority can provide for its CA, except that in this case, remember, the certification authority

262
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
has to be offline.

263
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You can have some physically secure location, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

264
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Not connected to the internet, right?

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This cannot be offline, right?

266
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Because millions of users or thousands of users are using it all the time, right?

267
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
To retrieve passwords from the vault, right?

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So the security requirements are harder.

269
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Because if something is online, it can be accessed, right?

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's reachable.

271
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay, but the good things are what?

272
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So if you use a password manager or password vault, where it's via an app or website, whatever,

273
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
you can have super strong passwords, random long passwords that you don't have to remember.

274
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It will remember them for you, right?

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Basically, what is the password vault of password manager?

276
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It has a small database for you, for your account, that lists all the websites or all the entities you do business with that require passwords.

277
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It has your username and it has your password in the clear somewhere, right?

278
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Because when you want to access the password manager and essentially to extract the password to enter into some website, it has to give you the password.

279
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It cannot give you a hash, right?

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It has to give you the whole thing.

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So, hmm.

282
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But anyway, it can have really strong passwords that you don't need to remember.

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It will make sure you don't reuse passwords across sites.

284
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Whereas, given freedom to do so, most people will be using passwords, right?

285
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Most of you probably do too.

286
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I know I have.

287
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Because it's just a pain to remember a lot of passwords.

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So, you go to one place, it's nice and convenient, like a supermarket.

289
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You go there to get all your goods, and there's only one strong password to remember.

290
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The one that unlocks the vault, right?

291
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's the password to other passwords.

292
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So, you could argue that that password could be strong and you should be forced to remember it, but it's only one.

293
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
As opposed to many, so it's just basic goodness.

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But let's look at the bad side.

295
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The bad side, that becomes like, yeah, a giant pot of honey for bees.

296
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Or, there's surely a better analogy somewhere.

297
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But, it is an attractive target, right?

298
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
This is, why do bank robbers rob the banks?

299
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Famously, because that's where the money is.

300
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Well, why would somebody attack a password load?

301
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because that's where the passwords are.

302
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And you can get a lot with those passwords, right?

303
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So, there's a lot at stake.

304
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Also, there's such a thing as insider attack.

305
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Which is people who work for that company, who might go rogue one day, and decide to copy or steal information.

306
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And sell it on the black market.

307
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay?

308
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
For profit.

309
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Then there's just other operational issues.

310
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Not too much a security issue, but not strictly.

311
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Where this password vault becomes a single point of failure.

312
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's basically a website, right?

313
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You go to that website, or you access it by an app on your smartphone.

314
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It is an entity, right?

315
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That has to be accessed.

316
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It isn't something that can be replicated on Akamai CDN.

317
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
No, it's a physical entity that has to be accessed.

318
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And so, if they have software upgrade, like they did last August, if you recall there was an incident.

319
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Right?

320
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Maybe you do not recall.

321
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That became a nightmare, because all the systems over the world, especially airlines, became inoperable.

322
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Then you have an outage.

323
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Or just somebody presses the wrong button, installs the wrong code, there's an outage.

324
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So this password vault is not accessible, because they're performing maintenance.

325
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, how are you going to get access to all the websites for which that vault knows the passwords, and you don't?

326
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Just prove.

327
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Denial of service attack.

328
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We'll talk about those later in the course.

329
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What if it is a massive distributed denial of service attack that essentially makes it impossible to access that password vault site?

330
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Even though it's operational, but you can't access it.

331
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You're screwed.

332
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And then it could be just internet problems, right?

333
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
If you have an internet problem, meaning a router that is somewhere on the way that an internet router or an internet provider crashes, you can't access it.

334
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And that completely gives you no service.

335
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So consider those when using the vault.

336
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Now, you might say, well, you know, if a smart company that runs one of those vaults wants to make the service ubiquitous, they will replicate things.

337
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Tell them, oh, but replicating passwords, that's a touchy-feely subject, right?

338
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
How do you do that security?

339
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And then you have to make sure that all the passwords are updated, right?

340
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
On all replicas.

341
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Then, surely you're all familiar with screen unlocked.

342
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
How many people use those?

343
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Not anymore?

344
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Wow, like five years ago.

345
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Pretty much more than that.

346
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Three quarters of the class would be using it.

347
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Anybody used them before?

348
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah.

349
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Okay.

350
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
All right.

351
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
See?

352
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
When did you start?

353
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
When you switched to an iPhone or?

354
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I think the phone all updated with Face ID.

355
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No matter Android or Android.

356
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Right, right.

357
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So that's what I also, I never used these screen patterns unlocked, but I know people did.

358
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
At one point, everybody, it seemed to me like everybody was using it.

359
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So, yeah, you're right.

360
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The face unlock and the fingerprint, to a lesser extent, became a more common way of unlocking, because it required no real effort.

361
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Right?

362
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But the claim to fame of the screen unlock, right?

363
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That pattern was it's easy to remember.

364
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Somehow, it felt like, I mean, at least studies at the time showed that it's easier for people to remember the unlock patterns than it is to remember pins.

365
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Right?

366
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Because phones usually don't take passwords, right?

367
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Phones were traditionally unlocked with pins.

368
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's just easier because phones have limited real estate, right?

369
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
On the screen, just playing a keyboard is awkward.

370
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Right?

371
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It is awkward.

372
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Right?

373
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Even for people with tiny fingers.

374
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So, cool.

375
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Back.

376
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Easy to remember, easy to enter, right?

377
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Just use your fingertips.

378
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
They're more intuitive than passwords.

379
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That's for sure.

380
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And more intuitive than pins.

381
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
On the other hand, they are specific to a particular phone on a particular screen.

382
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Right?

383
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Different phones have different screen layouts.

384
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Even when they show you a numeric pad, they often show you it in a different way.

385
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
There was no standardization.

386
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So, it was difficult to assure that the same, if you wanted to use the same unlock pattern

387
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
on multiple devices, you might not be able to do it.

388
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Um, then the screen smudges.

389
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I think I mentioned it earlier.

390
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I did.

391
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So, your fingertips have oils on them, normal.

392
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Right?

393
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It's not sweat or anything.

394
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Like, even a dry looking finger will have some oil on them.

395
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Right?

396
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And, um, it will leave smudges on the screen.

397
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, besides being annoying, meaning you have to clean the screen, it also leaves residue.

398
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And that residue can be used to deduce the thing.

399
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
If somebody, like, looks at your phone, even without you being there, and just, like,

400
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:33,000
takes a high-dress photo of the screen, they might be able to deduce at least parts of these finger movements that you made to unlock.

401
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It also turns out that there's acoustic leakage.

402
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Remember I mentioned about acoustic emanations from keyboards when you type in a password?

403
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Well, the same, to a lesser extent, but the same is true of, uh, dragging your fingertips across the screen.

404
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You make a noise.

405
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You might not hear it very well, but there is a noise being made.

406
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Because even though the screen is glass, right, there's still friction.

407
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And friction makes noise.

408
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Um, it is also more susceptible to shoulder surfing.

409
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And so the question is why?

410
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So think, remember shoulder surfing?

411
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I stand kind of behind you and kind of like, oh, look at what you're doing on the screen.

412
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And typically against passwords, right?

413
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Or pins.

414
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But this, the claim is, is more susceptible to shoulder surfing apart.

415
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Why do you think?

416
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Visual products are easy to remember.

417
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You don't even need to look at how he moved the finger.

418
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You only need to see how he moved the head.

419
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Maybe some people can guess.

420
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, yeah, true.

421
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But basically, the main reason what she said is that visual patterns are just easier to memorize.

422
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Okay?

423
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Now, if you have a camera, like, looking down on somebody's, like, for example, if there's a camera here and it's like looking at all your screens,

424
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
uh, there's no big difference between pins and unlock patterns.

425
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But if it's a human, definitely easier to remember and unlock that.

426
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Also, it proudly displays the whole pattern.

427
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It does!

428
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It does!

429
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It does!

430
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Which is weird, right?

431
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
In fact, I always wondered why it doesn't erase the tail.

432
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You know how you type a password and it will, like, linger, every character will linger for, like, a second and then it will be replaced by an asterisk or something?

433
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So the whole password is not displayed when you type it, obviously.

434
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Why even do the same for unlock patterns?

435
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It should be, like, a comment, right?

436
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Like, erasing its own tail.

437
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But they don't.

438
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
In the end, the entire pattern is visible.

439
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
True.

440
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You had a question.

441
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What?

442
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah, uh, back in the day, like, 2013, when Android all was, first off, popular, and screen-in-locks were all happening,

443
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
when you were setting up your phone, you had the option of, like, screen-in-lock, pin, password,

444
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
and they were all prominently really displayed.

445
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah.

446
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Nowadays, if you get a new Android, it isn't hidden.

447
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Like, you have to actually dig...

448
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So you think, you're saying it exists?

449
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Oh, it still exists, yeah.

450
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, it still exists, yeah.

451
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
My brother still uses it.

452
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You get the new phone number if you want.

453
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Okay, but when I asked...

454
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
What?

455
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Must be working for a phone number.

456
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But still, right?

457
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Nobody's using it today.

458
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
No, it's hidden.

459
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
No, no, but all of you, okay?

460
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Nobody's using it, right?

461
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Okay, interesting.

462
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Okay, you had a question.

463
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What's up?

464
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I was gonna say the tail disappeared in some of them.

465
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
In some of them it does?

466
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Okay, well, hallelujah.

467
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Good.

468
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
That would make more sense.

469
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And also, the last but not least, people do tend to pick predictable patterns.

470
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That's also been studied.

471
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah, you're not gonna pick some kind of a funny curly cue, right?

472
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Usually it's kind of like a very predictable rectangular, triangular pattern.

473
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
All right, so what can we do to strengthen passwords?

474
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Well, I mean, passwords themselves, we already kind of reached the limit, right?

475
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
There's no way...

476
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Okay, humans are literate today.

477
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
We all can...

478
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Because we use electronics, even those of us who don't go to...

479
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Don't finish high school, right?

480
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
There are people in the world, lots of people in the world who don't finish high school

481
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
or get barely elementary school education.

482
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
They still don't.

483
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Numbers, right?

484
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
They know letters.

485
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So literacy is good, reasonably good, better than it was 50 years ago or 100 years ago.

486
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But memorization is a problem, right?

487
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So already memorizing 12 character passwords or 12 position passwords is difficult, right?

488
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Assuming we even mix in special characters, numbers, lowercase, uppercase, et cetera.

489
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So we've kind of reached the limit, right?

490
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The humans are not going to develop beyond this.

491
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And so all of a sudden, the next generation is going to be remembering 20 character passwords.

492
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Not going to happen.

493
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Okay?

494
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So what can we do?

495
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Well, we can add biometrics.

496
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
That's kind of an easy answer, right?

497
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Add biometrics.

498
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And so, for example, I have fingerprints, ivory scans, dynamic biometrics like keystrokes, right?

499
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Voice prints, et cetera.

500
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But, and we'll talk about biometrics in more detail.

501
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
But the biggest problem with biometrics is revocation.

502
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Meaning if somebody, you know, if somebody's fingerprints were hijacked or somebody's keyboard patterns can be replicated, right?

503
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
By a pod.

504
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
How do you revolve it?

505
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Right?

506
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
How do you stop it?

507
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Because biometric is not something that can change, right?

508
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You're not going to suddenly change the way you type.

509
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You cannot change your DNA.

510
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Right?

511
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
We have genomic-based authentication.

512
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You cannot change your irises.

513
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Certainly you don't want to change your, you can change your fingerprints, but why?

514
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Let him out.

515
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I hope there's not a toilet here.

516
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Sometimes they put on, do unfortunate things like a bread bowl, there's a staff room with like coffee.

517
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And when you're there, it's next to it, on the other side of the wall is a toilet.

518
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So, every time somebody flushes, even if it unrolls toilet paper, you hear it, it's like, why?

519
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Why did they do this?

520
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I mean, it's really not pleasant.

521
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So, anyway, so the other possibility, so we'll talk about biometrics, but the other possibility is graphical passwords.

522
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Like image-based passwords.

523
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Okay?

524
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And so, maybe you have to strengthen things, right?

525
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So, one example is what's called image recognition.

526
00:31:47,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Because the idea is that we humans are kind of better, like this used to be much more true before than it is today, but we are generally better at recognizing images than bots or than computer programs.

527
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Right?

528
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So, one possibility is to say, okay, let's say the user's password or equivalent of a password is a sequence of images.

529
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Or a set, nothing in the sequence, a set of images.

530
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And there are many images we can show the user, but the user has to pick the right set.

531
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You kind of know what I'm saying?

532
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So, instead of memorizing something explicit to enter, you are asked to select a set of images that essentially are your passwords.

533
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But you are selecting them from a large set.

534
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Okay?

535
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
A large enough set.

536
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Right?

537
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And so, the idea is that, you know, yeah, you might think authenticity is similar to showing you a pinpad and you selecting the right digits.

538
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But you have to remember those digits.

539
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But you have to remember those digits where with images you are recognizing.

540
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Right?

541
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Rather remember you are recognizing.

542
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So, the motivation behind this is that it's difficult to mount dictionary attack on images.

543
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Right?

544
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Because they don't follow the same pattern as, let's say, human memory does when we're selecting, or human mind does when selecting passwords of him.

545
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Okay?

546
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Of course, images are not random, but some people like to believe they are.

547
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The one problem with images right away, if you use images for authentication, is that you cannot use very simple devices.

548
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Right?

549
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Something like a smartphone is going to be a challenge.

550
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Right?

551
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So, this is already not particularly good for, like, limited real estate devices.

552
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But for a tablet or a laptop, this is probably okay.

553
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Right?

554
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So, let's think about, like, how would you use a graphical password on a tablet, laptop, desktop type of device.

555
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Alright?

556
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Also, we need to think about shoulder surfing, because when somebody picks images, right, those picks are kind of visible, right?

557
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Obviously, right?

558
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Because they have to, like, click on them or somehow select them.

559
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Well, wouldn't displaying images reveal information because you know one of the images you selected at least has to be there?

560
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And so, if you just try to log in...

561
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Right, right, right.

562
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Okay, okay.

563
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So, let me give you a general idea.

564
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Let me give you a general idea.

565
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I mean, we'll go in this video.

566
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So, suppose I display to you on your laptop screen 12 images at a time.

567
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
One of them means something to you.

568
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
The others don't.

569
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You pick one.

570
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I display a second screen, 12 images.

571
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
One of them means something to you.

572
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The others don't.

573
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Click.

574
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I display the third, the fourth.

575
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So, that's what we do four times.

576
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Right.

577
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But if you need to have, like, hundreds of thousands of these images to be secured, then...

578
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Well, no, no, no.

579
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Not secured.

580
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
The point is that the equivalent of a password here would be the combination, the exact combination.

581
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
The one from the first screen, one from the second screen.

582
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Okay.

583
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So, how many?

584
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Well, there is like 12 to the power of four, right?

585
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
10,000.

586
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Combinations.

587
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Just repeat it over and over again.

588
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Like, remove the...

589
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Regenerate the...

590
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
No, no, no.

591
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
See, the idea is that there always has to be an image that is...

592
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Exactly.

593
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, exactly.

594
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah.

595
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Which one that repeats?

596
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Which one is always there, right?

597
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay.

598
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You're going way ahead.

599
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Right.

600
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You're getting ahead.

601
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Exactly.

602
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Exactly.

603
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So, now I'm just starting to think, like, paranoia, right?

604
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
A little bit of suspicion.

605
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
That's how security people do.

606
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But the idea was like this.

607
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm just telling you this because this is what people try to replace password, replace password.

608
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And the moral of the story at the end, which I'm going to jump to anyway, is passwords are here to stay for a reason.

609
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Because not for the lack of trying to replace them with something.

610
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So, here's an example.

611
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's called past faces.

612
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And at one point, it was like a really popular thing.

613
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And so, and from this quote, you can see where it's going.

614
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's a beautiful solution, but it's completely wrong.

615
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And so, this is like the pitch.

616
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The pitch is, you are really good, you humans, you know, are really good at recognizing faces.

617
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Right?

618
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
They really mean something to you.

619
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's really like a decision problem, right?

620
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So, you know, in computational complexity, there are computation problems and decision problems.

621
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah?

622
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Remember this from complexity or algorithms?

623
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Well, recognition is a decision problem that your brain goes through.

624
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Do I know this space or do I not know this space?

625
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Okay?

626
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So, a password is a computation problem, meaning that you have to fetch it from the storage somewhere in your brain.

627
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Whereas that recognition is a decision problem.

628
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So, for us, clearly, this is absolutely true, that it's easier to recognize a face than to remember a password.

629
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Okay?

630
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Of course, let's forget for a second, people with severe eyesight issues or blind people.

631
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Okay?

632
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That's not, of course, universal.

633
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Okay?

634
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But then passwords for people with no hands or, you know, malformed fingers are also different.

635
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So, again, this is like a marketing pitch.

636
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Never forget a face.

637
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Alright?

638
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So, let's skip to this.

639
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So, the idea is a user will be enrolled into a system that will show them, like a training exercise, a set of faces.

640
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And they will be assigned a set of, let's say, six faces and repeatedly trained on recognizing those faces.

641
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Presumably within some time limit, like 30 minutes, 20 minutes, they will be given exercises to recognize those five, six faces that they're assigned to them.

642
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah?

643
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Then, after enrollment, whenever they want to log in, they will be shown sequences of these kind of vignettes, like 12 at a time, 10 at a time, and ask to pick a face that is one of theirs.

644
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Okay?

645
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
That's the main idea.

646
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Okay?

647
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So, you have a library, but you must have, of course, a big library of faces.

648
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But that's easy, right?

649
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You just collect, it's easy to collect a big library of black faces.

650
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You can have different ages, genders, facial growth, hairstyles, all kinds of people, different races.

651
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And then, there is a user interface, where users are initially assigned, in this example, five faces.

652
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Okay?

653
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And, each of the five faces is associated with decoys, right?

654
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So, when you're trained, you see the blonde, over there, with bangs, that's your face.

655
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
This guy, smiling guy, over there in the middle is your face.

656
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
This lady is your face, et cetera, et cetera.

657
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So, these are five faces that are supposed to be for you to remember.

658
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Okay?

659
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And now, every time you log in, you are shown a sequence of this, and this, and this, and this, and this.

660
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And you must select, and maybe, maybe this is a different order, maybe in a different order.

661
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
The order doesn't matter.

662
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
The order could be perturbed.

663
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Right?

664
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You can show this first, and that, and this.

665
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The thing is, you remember, you're supposed to remember the faces that are associated with you.

666
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So, it's the same set of eight faces at the time.

667
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Now, it's the same set of eight, but this might appear here.

668
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Right?

669
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So, the order of these five screens would change.

670
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Right?

671
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
This can be random.

672
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And the placement of your face within each screen will change too.

673
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Okay?

674
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So, on a given screen that you're shown with, in this case, nine faces, one of them is yours.

675
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Its position is random.

676
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So, this is the original enrollment, familiarization process, blah, blah, blah.

677
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And so, the claim is that once you memorize, it's like there's a cookie in your brain.

678
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Like a web cookie, you know, browser cookie.

679
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
That helps you recognize that.

680
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And maybe, indeed, that's how the brain works.

681
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I mean, like we, I think there's actually a cookie, but there is something, some state information

682
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
that's stored in your brain.

683
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's like when you see the same, like, character actor in the movie, in several movies.

684
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Right?

685
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You kind of recognize them again.

686
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You might not remember their face.

687
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Sorry.

688
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You might not remember their name.

689
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Right?

690
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Because, you know, many character actors, but you recognize them.

691
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So, this is what's called cognometrics.

692
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Right?

693
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Biometrics is cognometrics, because you're not using any innate property of yourself as a human.

694
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You're using your recognition capabilities.

695
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And this was, believe it or not, this was really popular for a while.

696
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It really, like, the company that came up with it, they were, like, riding super hot.

697
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It was one of those unicorn stars.

698
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So, there's two variations, and you can think already which one is better.

699
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
There's variations where the system assigns you faces, like the one you just saw.

700
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And there's another variation where the user picks faces.

701
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Like, you're given, like, a vignette of, like, nine, and you say, I like this face.

702
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And another vignette of nine, and you pick another face.

703
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Okay?

704
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Now, presumably, a user will pick faces they can remember better, right?

705
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So, there's less training.

706
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Now, a third possibility you can imagine where the user uploads their own faces.

707
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Now, they didn't know for this.

708
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Anybody can see why?

709
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Because if somebody mounts an attack, a dictionary attack, right?

710
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Or, sort of, an attack on somebody's fast pace.

711
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And they know that the system allows them to upload their own photos.

712
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Well, they're probably likely to know who are your friends, relatives, etc.

713
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Right?

714
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Right?

715
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So, do you have treatment?

716
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So, that's why that was not offered, right?

717
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Where a user uploads their own photos.

718
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Also, by highlighting.

719
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That is also true, right?

720
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So, yeah, of course, you can deal with that by varying lighting and so on, and, you know, reducing green light, increasing green light.

721
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But, they didn't offer that.

722
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Then, a bunch of people at, some researchers at John Plotkin's, and CMU, did a study of this.

723
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And, this is, which brought the whole house and cars down.

724
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
They studied the user-selected fast pace variant.

725
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Because, the system-selected one turned out not to be very practical.

726
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
People were just forgetting faces.

727
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Right?

728
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The user-selected one worked better.

729
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
When I say user-selected, it's the second one.

730
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Right?

731
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:39,000
The conclusion was, that people tend to pick very biased faces.

732
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Right?

733
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The race and gender, or ethnicity and gender, have a lot to do with it.

734
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Is that any of the surprising?

735
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That's how we are.

736
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
That's how we operate.

737
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Right?

738
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And, particularly, it was, it was particularly bad for male students.

739
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
But, they didn't experiment on students.

740
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So, keep that in mind, it's a specific preparation.

741
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Right?

742
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So, meaning two guesses of faces were enough for most, sorry, for 10% of male users, and eight guesses were enough for a quarter.

743
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
To basically get their fast faces.

744
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Because, they would just pick, I don't know, the prettiest girls.

745
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah.

746
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And, in fact, yeah?

747
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Then, why not show all the particular in the same row, and then choose the only one level?

748
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Because, they were simply not enough.

749
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Right?

750
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You have to mix in others.

751
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah.

752
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
But, I mean, I actually don't know the reasoning.

753
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
But, they would always consist, I mean, they tended to pick a very predictable kind of a face.

754
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So, in the end, the system should probably pick, for security purposes, it's better for the system to pick faces for users than for users to pick faces.

755
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Because, users will always exercise some bias, depending on their characteristics.

756
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
But, if the system picks faces, then you have a high error rate, and that's what they've observed.

757
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Also, some people have what is called dyspagia.

758
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It's a condition where they are unable to recognize faces.

759
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
There's a small percentage of humans all over the world that have this condition.

760
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:31,000
There is a book by a neuroscientist called, A Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.

761
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And, he talks about, you know, patients that have that issue.

762
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
How's it?

763
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Personal technology.

764
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Personal technology.

765
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Personal, okay.

766
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
There you go.

767
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah.

768
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Personal technology.

769
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It's rare, but it's not completely unknown.

770
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Also, you need these displays.

771
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So, this is not good enough for smartphones.

772
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It was supposed to be good enough for, like, laptops, desks.

773
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And also, last but not least, changing a set of faces is really hard.

774
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It's harder than past ones.

775
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Okay?

776
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It really is hard.

777
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Now, think about why this is.

778
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
This was also studied.

779
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Because, all these, you know, like, old faces, they're still here.

780
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So, you cannot erase the cookies from your brain.

781
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
The past faces that, say, you used in last year, are still in your brain.

782
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And, when you change, on January 1st, a new set of past faces, you will have a really hard

783
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
time remembering which ones are from each.

784
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So, that was like, I think, a final nail in the coffin of this method.

785
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Now, shoulder surfing.

786
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Generally, graphical passwords, as are unlocked patterns, are more vulnerable to shoulder surfing.

787
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Okay?

788
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Because, selecting pictures, right, recognizable pictures, is just more visible.

789
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And, also, it takes time, right?

790
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So, with a password, if you do remember the password, it doesn't take the past.

791
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It didn't take the past.

792
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
The recognition takes longer.

793
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Because, you're going to see, let's say, in the example I showed, you'll see a small,

794
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I mean, a screen with nine photos.

795
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And, the position of the person's face, that is part of your past face, password, is going

796
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
to change.

797
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
So, your eyes have to go around, like, and find that face.

798
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
That takes longer, and that means it's easier to shoulder surfing.

799
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So, there was an experiment done, a shoulder surfing experiment at the University of Maryland,

800
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
in Baltimore County, where people were using two types of passwords.

801
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Pass faces with a mouse.

802
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
That's saying pass faces with a mouse.

803
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Mouse means, yeah, you mouse over the face that you recognize, click.

804
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Then, there's pass faces with a keyboard, where you basically use the arrow keys to move.

805
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Dictionary text passwords is a normal password.

806
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Non-dictionary text passwords with random words and numbers.

807
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And, the result was, actually, non-dictionary text passwords was the worst.

808
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
That is, the best for shoulder surfing, but the worst for the users.

809
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And, maybe you can tell me why that is.

810
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Because, when you're typing non-dictionary text, you're kind of typed slower, because it's not a word, and...

811
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It's not a word, and it's like...

812
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

813
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Getting your fingers moving in really weird ways.

814
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
That's right.

815
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So, that really is the only reason.

816
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
The only reason.

817
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Now, one of the things that has been used, one of the techniques that has been used for pin entry,

818
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:04,000
that has been relatively successful, but it's really terrible for shoulder surfing, is this.

819
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Maybe some of you have encountered it.

820
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Yeah.

821
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So, normally, you enter a pin by just typing in the number, right?

822
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Anybody's ever seen other ways of entering a pin?

823
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Okay, so...

824
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Let me see if I...

825
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I'm not sure what you're saying, but like...

826
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Instead of being one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

827
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Oh, oh, oh, right.

828
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Scramble keypad, right?

829
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Scramble keypad.

830
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Okay.

831
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah.

832
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
On the screen.

833
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
On the screen.

834
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
On the screen.

835
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
On the screen.

836
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yes, I've seen those.

837
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Not recently.

838
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Does anybody see why?

839
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Well, it slows you down.

840
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Which is really bad for shoulder surfing.

841
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
But why do they do it?

842
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Well, I guess that fixes the smudging problem.

843
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Well, there's no smudging because you're typing, right?

844
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So, they're clicking.

845
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I think it's protecting for maybe some other app in your own phone.

846
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Yes.

847
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It's trying to protect from somebody, like, looking which part of the screen you type.

848
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So, if there's some malicious program, whether it's on a smartphone or an air or an computer,

849
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
it's trying to protect from somebody, like, looking which part of the screen you type.

850
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So, if there's some malicious program, whether it's on a smartphone or an air or a computer,

851
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
it's looking what part of the screen was clicked, they won't know.

852
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
They won't know, right?

853
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
We will know if the layout of the pin path is constant.

854
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But if it varies, they won't know, right?

855
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
But the way that I was talking about is different.

856
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Suppose that instead of entering the pin, what you have to do is use arrow keys to adjust a random number to your pin.

857
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Has anybody seen that?

858
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So, you're displaying a pin, which is some, let's say it's four digits, right?

859
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You're displaying a 7, 9, 2, 5.

860
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And your pin is actually 8, 1, 3, 7.

861
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Right?

862
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
This is your pin.

863
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But the number you see on the screen is this.

864
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So, what you do is you use an arrow key once, then you sideways arrow key, right?

865
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Sideways arrow key, then down 8, 8 clicks down, sideways, 1 click up, sideways, 2 clicks up.

866
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Do you follow what I'm saying?

867
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You essentially take a random number and adjust it to your pin.

868
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Really terrible for shoulder surfing, because at the end of this, what will be displayed?

869
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Your pin.

870
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Right?

871
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Because you're adjusting a random number to the pin, yes?

872
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
But what is it good for?

873
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
The entry is never the same.

874
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:27,000
The entry is never the same, and if there's a keyboard sniffer, a key logger, or a person in another room with a microphone listening to the clicks, what are they going to hear?

875
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Different sequence.

876
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Different sequence every time.

877
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Different sequence.

878
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Different sequence every time.

879
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Don't make yourself puzzled.

880
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Look at, look, look.

881
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It's really an excellent method when somebody cannot look at your screen.

882
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Right?

883
00:53:42,000 --> 00:54:03,000
If the adversary is eavesdropping acoustically, or the adversary is recording the keystrokes, like because they planted some malicious driver on their keyboard, or some app that gets privileges to actually record the keystrokes, this method is excellent.

884
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
The problem is, it does display your pin in the end.

885
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So if somebody is also looking at the screen, it does.

886
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Right, so, if you want to read more about it, there's a nice article titled, Why Are We All Such Idiots?

887
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And it tells you about password ticks.

888
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
This is Maurice, well, Maurice, like nine years old.

889
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Now, let's look at biometrics for a sec.

890
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Biometric authentication is, on the surface, kind of nice.

891
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
There's nothing to remember.

892
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Absolutely nothing to remember with biometrics.

893
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I mean, other than like, this is my finger, this is my face.

894
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So, as long as you remember where your face is and where your fingers are, you're okay.

895
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
There's nothing to compute, generally, right?

896
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
With biometrics.

897
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
There's no device to carry around for you, right?

898
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Now, okay, yes, phone is a device you do carry around, but in prior time, right?

899
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Phones are not an issue, right?

900
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
If you wanted to get access to a system, right?

901
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
A mainframe computer or network, or enter a building, and it was protected by biometrics,

902
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
there's nothing you need to carry around, right?

903
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Today, if the phone is what you want to get into, and you use a biometrics,

904
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
you don't have to carry around anything additional.

905
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
All right.

906
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Biometrics cannot be shared.

907
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
That's the other problem.

908
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
A lot of people who share passwords.

909
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Like, let's say, all the streaming sites, right?

910
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
How many of you share passwords on your streaming site?

911
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I bet all of you do, right?

912
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I mean, I personally mooch off my kids, you know?

913
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I mean, I paid enough for them, now they can pay for my streaming pleasures.

914
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So, yeah, we share pins, we share passwords.

915
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
If we need to have biometrics, you cannot share, right?

916
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You can't, right?

917
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It's just fundamentally shouldn't be possible.

918
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Which is good, right?

919
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
So, imagine, I'm not hoping this will happen, but I wouldn't be surprised if next year Netflix

920
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
says, oh, you know, you want to use your Netflix account?

921
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Well, stick your eyes in here, or come close to the camera, or like, you know,

922
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
look at your face, or face unlock with your phone, and it will give you a code, right?

923
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So, something like that.

924
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Can be pretty unique, right?

925
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It's not always unique.

926
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Not all biometrics are good enough, but, and they do vary quite a bit, but generally, they

927
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
can be made sufficiently accurate.

928
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But the problems right away with biometrics is that they offer two things.

929
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,000
One is identification, which is associating an identity, right, with some action or data,

930
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
right?

931
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Like a, like forensically finding a fingerprint in a crime scene, right?

932
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
That's identifying a criminal, right?

933
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And authentication is verifying an identity, like verifying that you are here right now.

934
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Do you see the difference?

935
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Verification of live identity, right?

936
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You are here right now.

937
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Like when your phone looks at your face, right?

938
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's like, you are here right now.

939
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Not you were here before, right?

940
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
But you are here right now.

941
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
That's authentication.

942
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:50,000
The difficulty of forgery is difficult to estimate, because it varies from biometric to biometric.

943
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But it's usually overestimate.

944
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
There are computer generated forgeries.

945
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
There are also, with 3D printers, things become very interesting.

946
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
For example, fingerprints, right?

947
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:15,000
You can actually take somebody's fingerprint and easily, well, if you have access to a 3D printer, print a finger.

948
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Just a disconnected thing that has a cushiony, human-like skin-cut feel, and perfectly replicates everything in the finger.

949
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I mean, in the same way, you could also print somebody's face in 3D.

950
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
What is difficult to do in 3D is to make it live.

951
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
And you have it moving, right?

952
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Have the lips moving, nose moving, et cetera.

953
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:53,000
But just to print the face, and that would fool some of the, maybe not current, but earlier face recognition.

954
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Unlocks it.

955
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It's totally doable.

956
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And it's been demonstrated.

957
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
As I said before, revocation of biometrics is really hard.

958
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And you need an infrastructure.

959
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Right?

960
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:15,000
If you have a biometric based authentication in a company, let's say, on a company brand.

961
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Anybody ever work for a company that uses biometrics?

962
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
No?

963
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Hmm.

964
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Thank you.

965
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
There's somebody else.

966
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
You did?

967
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
No.

968
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
What kind of admin?

969
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
We did fingerprints.

970
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Fingerprints.

971
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Well, so, that means readers, right?

972
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So, it wasn't like you could come to the badge reader at the door of the company, put your phone there, and then unlock your phone, and it will let you know.

973
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Right?

974
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
So, my guess is you have to put your finger on their fingerprint reader, right?

975
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And so, every door had to be protected through the fingerprint.

976
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
That implies infrastructure.

977
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Right?

978
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
It also implies enrollment.

979
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And enrollment is what all of you go through when you do the first, when you get a new phone and you do the face unlock enrollment or fingerprint enrollment.

980
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Now, face unlock enrollment is not that difficult, right?

981
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
How long does it take for you?

982
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Give me an info card.

983
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
That's reasonably fast.

984
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Anybody who took long?

985
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
A minute.

986
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
A minute.

987
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Okay.

988
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So, let's say a minute.

989
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It's not a big deal these days, right?

990
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Anybody remember doing fingerprint enrollment?

991
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
That took a long time.

992
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
It's annoying.

993
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Right?

994
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Because sometimes it will not take your finger because you're going to put it the right way, right?

995
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
That was very annoying.

996
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I mean, my previous phone had fingerprint enrollment.

997
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And also, well, I had high error rates.

998
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
If my finger was wet, it wouldn't work.

999
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
If my finger was dry, very dry, I had chalk on it, it wouldn't work.

1000
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So, it was okay.

1001
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Faces are better.

1002
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Anyway, but the point here is you need infrastructure, right?

1003
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So, forget, here we're used to this, right?

1004
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Unlocking this.

1005
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
This is easy.

1006
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
There's not a lot of infrastructure other than the camera to do face unlock.

1007
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Right?

1008
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And some software, some fancy software that actually supports it.

1009
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Right?

1010
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
For fingerprint, the same even less, right?

1011
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Well, now they don't even have to.

1012
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But, if you want to do it on an enterprise-wide basis, that's an expensive investment.

1013
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You need to actually have all the device input devices, right?

1014
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
For people through or for fingerprint.

1015
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Right?

1016
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It must have all these other programs.

1017
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
This is more formal.

1018
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Right?

1019
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You need to consider using biometrics.

1020
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
It has to be universal.

1021
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Right?

1022
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
It has to be usable by most people.

1023
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So, if you suggest a biometric that only works for people with white skin, that isn't

1024
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
good.

1025
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Or, if you suggest a biometric that only is usable for people who are right-handed, that's

1026
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
not going to work.

1027
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Right?

1028
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Now, if you say, well, sorry, my biometric does not work for mute people.

1029
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Okay, it's not nice, but it's probably reasonably acceptable.

1030
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So, you have to make sure it's as universal as possible.

1031
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Unique.

1032
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
There must be sufficient degree of distinction.

1033
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So, one biometric that has been proposed in the past is gait.

1034
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Gait is the way you walk.

1035
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Okay?

1036
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Turns out, most people walk in a very particular way.

1037
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Is it unique?

1038
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
No.

1039
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:34,000
There's other problems, but among other things, it's not unique.

1040
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Permanence.

1041
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
This is consistency over time.

1042
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Does the biometric stay the same, or does it change?

1043
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
For example, your genome stays the same.

1044
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Does your face stay the same?

1045
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Hmm?

1046
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Hmm?

1047
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Hmm?

1048
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Hmm?

1049
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Hmm?

1050
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Hmm?

1051
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Not certain, right?

1052
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Not certain.

1053
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
What about your fingerprints?

1054
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah, your fingerprints stay the same as long as you don't cut them off or, you know,

1055
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
have a certain skin condition.

1056
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Eczema.

1057
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:13,000
But otherwise, the generally stays the same.

1058
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Unobtrusiveness.

1059
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Does it disrupt the normal flow?

1060
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Well, if you tell me that before I enter the building I need to walk three times like

1061
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
this in front of the door, there's going to be a large queue and I'm going to be very annoying.

1062
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
So, it's definitely obtrusive, right?

1063
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
So, unobtrusiveness is fine, right?

1064
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Maybe a fingerprint is not very obtrusive.

1065
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
A face is reasonably not very obtrusive, right?

1066
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You're used to it now with TSA, right?

1067
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
When you go to the airport.

1068
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Increasingly, they're starting to use face recognition.

1069
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Right?

1070
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
They don't even ask you, some of the places don't even ask you for a boarding pass anymore.

1071
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Have you seen that?

1072
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I've encountered several times in the last six to eight months.

1073
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And they don't ask you for a boarding pass.

1074
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
You just do a face recognition piece.

1075
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Circumvention difficulty.

1076
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
It should be hard to impersonate others, but that relates to uniqueness.

1077
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Equipment cost, right?

1078
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It cannot cost an arm in a lab.

1079
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
And easy enrollment things.

1080
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Or how difficult it is to enroll people in that boundary.

1081
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Enrolling people in something like a handwriting biometric.

1082
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Right?

1083
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Where they recognize your handwriting, but that's pretty time-fixing.

1084
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Enrolling in face biometrics, as you said, is not difficult.

1085
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:47,000
There is in biometrics something called fraud rate, or basically a false positive.

1086
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Everybody familiar, I'm sure, with fraud positive?

1087
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Right?

1088
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
And the insult rate.

1089
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Yeah.

1090
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
That's an old term.

1091
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
It means a false negative.

1092
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Right?

1093
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
False negative means the system says, yeah, go away.

1094
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I don't know you.

1095
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Right?

1096
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
That's an insult.

1097
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Right?

1098
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
To the customer, right?

1099
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
That's a false insult to me.

1100
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So, some companies that use biometrics, like banks, they're very, very concerned about insults.

1101
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Right?

1102
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Because they want to piss off the customer.

1103
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
The government doesn't care.

1104
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
They don't care about the insult.

1105
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Right?

1106
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
So, fraud rate is false positive.

1107
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Right?

1108
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
That is, how can you, the circumvention of biometrics, how is it to circumvent?

1109
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
In some cases, how is it to mistakenly not recognize somebody?

1110
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Right?

1111
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
So, usually they are like interdependent, like a seesaw.

1112
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
We increase one, the other one goes down, and the other way around.

1113
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:53,000
For face recognition, today, this has been a big, a big jump in efficacy.

1114
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
But today, the error rates tend to be around 1% for face recognition.

1115
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
That's for the best face recognition algorithms today.

1116
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Or just even under 1%.

1117
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And this is down from like 5% 10 years ago, and 20% 15 years ago.

1118
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
So, there's been some amazing progress in face recognition.

1119
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Doesn't mean that's going to be your experience with your smartphone.

1120
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Because you're not running the fastest, the most advanced face recognition.

1121
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Just because your smartphone isn't capable of doing, you know, that much computation.

1122
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
But, have you noticed that over time, the face recognition improved?

1123
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Especially with iPhones.

1124
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I mean, I'm not a fan of iPhones, but I found that iPhone face recognition is pretty good.

1125
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Like, I rarely have issues.

1126
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Whereas before, when I used the early Android face recognition, it was terrible.

1127
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Any kind of shadow, any kind of a hat, anything like that would throw it off.

1128
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And fingerprints were just horrific.

1129
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
They were super annoying.

1130
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,000
But fingerprints have been around for a long time.

1131
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Oh, sorry.

1132
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
If you use weak hardware, like if you use IoT devices that use face recognition,

1133
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
then the error rates will go up to like 40 or so.

1134
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
So that's not very good.

1135
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Also, consider this.

1136
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Injuries, right?

1137
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
You have a, you know, you run into a wall or something.

1138
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,000
So, you know, you get into a fight, you know, part of your face like swells up.

1139
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
That influences face recognition a lot.

1140
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Hair, shouldn't, right?

1141
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
The really good algorithms, they don't, facial hair does not sway them,

1142
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
but the cheaper algorithms, the faster algorithms do.

1143
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Medicines, drugs that alter, sometimes you'll have like bags under your eyes

1144
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:55,000
or any kind of like things that, side effects of illegal drugs or just regular pharmaceutical medicine.

1145
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Plastic surgery clearly will alter your face, right?

1146
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:07,000
So that's even something like a small nose job or a, what do you call it?

1147
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Lip injections can cause lack of recognition.

1148
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Acne, your acne will also cause problems.

1149
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
So facial recognition has still some challenges.

1150
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Now, fingerprints were really popular before, right?

1151
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
They've been used since like actually 19th century.

1152
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
They were sort of, the whole process started in criminology in France, I think, in the 19th century.

1153
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But the US, the first conviction was in 1911 based on fingerprint evidence.

1154
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
So there's a lot of science behind using fingerprints.

1155
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I mean, they're used today for crime scenes, identification, right, et cetera.

1156
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
They're reasonably unique, right?

1157
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
If you get an actual fingerprint, right, a full fingerprint, they're really unique.

1158
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
The probability of collision is like 1 in 10 billion, maybe even less today.

1159
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,000
The problem is, well, generally fingerprints don't change, right?

1160
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Unlike with the face, they don't change with time, right?

1161
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So a child's fingerprint is still going to have the same patterns and the same person when they are an adult.

1162
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
The finger size, the fingertip size will grow, but the patterns will stay.

1163
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:31,000
So it will grow proportionally, which means that modern fingerprint algorithms can accommodate, let's say, a teenager or a tween,

1164
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
who are still going to grow, but the algorithm will still recognize their finger.

1165
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:43,000
But eczema and, you know, scars and missing fingers, of course, indeed, lead up.

1166
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I think we are, oh, time to be done, yeah?

1167
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Yeah?

1168
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Is that 1 in 10 billion genetically, or...?

1169
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
No, no, no, no.

1170
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I think genetically you are, I mean, in the analog world, you are unique when it's actually a fingerprint.

1171
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Now, I'm not speaking from, like, real knowledge here, but I remember reading something that, you know, you are unique, but the problem is the accuracy of it.

1172
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Taking the fingerprints, right?

1173
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
That's why it's only 10 billion.

1174
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
You should be good at it.

1175
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Okay.

1176
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,000
So, again, if you have not sent me your project proposal, you need to do it to our SAP.

1177
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
If I don't get it by the end of the day, you will lose points.

1178
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
So, please get on the ball.

1179
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Let's just stick down the ball.

1180
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:41,000
.

1181
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
.
