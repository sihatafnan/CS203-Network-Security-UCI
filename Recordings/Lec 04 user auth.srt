1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
like SSL that we're going to go over later and there's some wireless, I think it ends

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
with some firewalls which also will go in depth and wireless.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Any questions from us?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So again, I would like to have your new proposals by next Tuesday, like last time.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you have any fundamental questions there about what I expect, ask.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll have officers on Monday.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Again, I want to deal with two people.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No double dipping means not to use material that you did already or you're doing in parallel

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
in some other course.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So there has to be something distinct that you do for this part.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And if you plan to do writing, survey or something like that, no chatbots.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That should be you.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If you do use some tools that you are not sure, or you want to use some tools, you're not quite sure if this transcends the boundary, just ask.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's easier to ask now than to explain later.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, so user authentication, one of the basic topics in computer security.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
How do we authenticate humans?

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That means us.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All right, basic problem.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Somebody claims to be Alice or Bob, and now how do you prove that you are that Alice or Bob?

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now why do we do authentication?

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We do authentication in order to enforce access control.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right, just authentication for the sake of authentication isn't useful.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What's the point of authenticating you if nothing happens?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And any form of, any time you are asked for anything that identifies you and authenticates you, it's for some purpose.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Whether it's a policeman that stops you and says, where's your driver's license?

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The driver's license is to let you go.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you authenticate you, you let you go.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Then you get a ticket.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And without the driver's license, you might get arrested.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So no access to driving privileges, right?

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If you work for a company, you use a badge and maybe sometimes a camera to authenticate you as an employee, right?

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So you can have access to the premises.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You get into the UCI's Google space, right?

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Google Docs and Drive space.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You authenticate it via a dual and password username so you can get access to those resources, et cetera, et cetera.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So there's always a reason for why you are being authenticated, right?

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There is something that you are given access to if you succeed in authentication.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So this pops up just about everywhere.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So, of course, as you know, there are many ways to prove that you are.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Say you are.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The most familiar ones are passwords.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Their demise has been predicted for the last 40 years, and yet they are still here.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Moreover, they show no signs of going away anytime soon.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
An interesting parallel, email.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Email has been around since early 80s.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Pretty much the same way it is used to be.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Maybe the WYSIWYG changed, you know, the here and there, but the interfaces, et cetera.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But email is pretty much the same.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Same format email addresses, and every year somebody says, yeah, I guarantee it.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You know, it's like a doomsday.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You say, oh, yeah, the end of the world is coming tomorrow.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Just you wait.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And tomorrow comes, ah, you know what?

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My clock was wrong.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I was like, yeah, it missed you.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Anyway, ah, the stars did not align.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So the same thing about email and password, doomsday predictions.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Email is still here.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Password is still here.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No signing going on.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Right.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So passwords we know, and nobody loves them, but we're used to them.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And then we have passphrases, right?

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Or answers to personal questions.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Like, what color eyes do you like the most?

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Or, what was the make of your first automobile?

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Really difficult questions, right?

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then there are, of course, secret keys, right?

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So we can use some secret keys.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you can remember them, you can use them, right?

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Or you can write them down, which will be a lot of fun.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But these are things you know, presumably.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Pins are, of course, another form.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's a variation of the theme of passwords, right?

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Because they're supposed to be numbers, not alphanumeric characters.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then you can do authentication based on where you are.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So that is, if you are in some space, and you can prove you are in some space, geographical

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
location, then you must have access to something.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You might be giving access to something.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Like, if you are in some secure room in the Pentagon, by virtue of being in that secure

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
room, you're allowed to access some computer system or some database.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm not saying that's how it should be, but it can be like that.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It could also be an IP address given to you by your internet provider.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So, for example, if you live in the campus housing, your entry is provided by UCI, right?

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
As opposed to, say, me, I also live on campus, Canada campus, I think on Union Hills here,

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
next to campus, my address is provided by Cox.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And all my neighbors are in the cost of Google to buy them.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So the IP address tells you something.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If you believe me, the IP address, of course.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It could be home phone, right?

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Of course, people don't use home phones anymore, right?

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Landlines are rare.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Cell phone.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Cell phone used to be able to, many, many, many years ago, if you had a certain cell phone number,

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
then you had to be in a particular space, because back then there was no roaming, right?

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So if your phone number worked, that means you were, you know, with a 949 area code,

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you were in North County.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It doesn't work anymore.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now, MAC addresses, could they be used for identifying where you are, right?

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Or for anything at all?

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Everybody knows what MAC addresses is, right?

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Theoretically, MAC addresses supposed to tell you something about the interface of the device.

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Any ideas?

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No?

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Too early?

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
MAC addresses have a special format.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They actually should tell you who the manufacturer of the device, or the interface.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It doesn't tell you necessarily where you are, and that's why I put a question mark there.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Also, MAC addresses are impermanent.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There was a time when most devices that have MAC addresses, you couldn't change them.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Today, you can change MAC addresses on most laptops, industrial or desktop systems, most laptops, cell phones, and other guys.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Also, even if MAC addresses were impermanent, MAC addresses are only used for the one hub, right?

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's a data link layer.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So, in this room, the MAC address is only visible to the access point.

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But beyond the access point, it has no meaning, right?

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There's nothing.

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It doesn't longer go there.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, then there's what you are as a human, right?

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Now, what you are are your intrinsic features, like your DNA, right?

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Your fingerprints, your eyes, your face geometry, your hand geometry, your vein pattern on your wrist.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There's gait, where you are, not a very good biometric, but that's in you.

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
All kinds of other things.

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And then there is the one that you are familiar with the most, which is what you have, right?

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's a possession of something.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We know this, right?

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is the most frequent two-factor.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You have the app on your phone, and it's visually secure.

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You trust the app.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The app will pop up, right?

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Either with the approve, disapprove, or a code, right?

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The temporary code, that essentially, by entering that code or hitting approve,

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you're saying, I'm in possession of this phone.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And because this phone has been pre-registered as associated with you,

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
there's a reasonable assumption that because you have this phone,

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and previously you entered the right password and username,

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
must be the case that you are a police agent.

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And if you think of it, any other?

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Might I miss something?

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Any other basis upon which you can be authenticated?

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What you know, where you are, what you are, what you have.

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Some people suggested where you've been, but that's hard to remember.

143
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So, how do our passwords work?

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No.

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Quiet track.

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
No.

147
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Without a sign.

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So, must not be able to remember.

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Right.

151
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So, you have a secret password.

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You pick the secret password, and the system checks to authenticate that password.

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Now, sometimes, of course, you don't pick the secret password,

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
sometimes the secret password is given to you.

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Like, how many of you have used a browser to select a secret password?

156
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Then you don't actually know anything.

157
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Right?

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
All you do is, what?

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You log into your computer, or your, uh, smartphone computer, like that.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And, the idea is that the browser, especially something like Chrome, let's say.

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I want to pick, I use Firefox sometimes here, but let's say Chrome, which is popular.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Um, you also have to log into your profile, right?

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
On Chrome.

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So, you log into the computer, you log into the browser, but the browser doesn't know what

165
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
you log into the computer.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So, in fact, you log into your profile on Chrome, and that essentially unlocks the so-called

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:30,000
password vault, or password bundle, that is stored in your profile on Chrome.

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Not super reassuring, right?

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But, convenient, because as long as you use that Chrome, right?

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Actually, it doesn't have to be Chrome there, right?

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You could be using Chrome somewhere else.

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You know, if you set it up correctly, that password that Chrome picked for you will be available

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
once you authenticate with the right folder.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Right.

175
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So, initialization, but typically the password initialization is you pick the password based

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
on some password rules.

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Which vary, of course, from site to site, from time to time.

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And, um, how do you actually communicate with the log in time for the first time, right?

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Or for subsequent times, right?

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There is always this risk of eavesdropping.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Right?

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So, if you imagine the most naive way of communicating a password is you type your password and then

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
it just goes somewhere.

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Now, if it's a local computer, maybe you can have a little more trust.

185
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You trust the operating system that the log in prompt is actually from the operating system.

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Right?

187
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So, when you turn on your laptop, you have tablets and laptops, and when you open it, so turn

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
it on, and the log in prompt occurs, and says, usually it doesn't say username, right?

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You can't, right?

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But usually it just ends your password.

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Do you know who's asking you for a password?

192
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Who's still a computer?

193
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Do you know who's asking?

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Should be the operating system.

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Should be the operating system.

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Is it the operating system?

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Do you have any way to verify that, in fact, the window that shows you the login is the operating

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
system window?

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I say no.

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't think you know.

201
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Maybe if you have an encrypted disk, would you type in your password and connect it for

202
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:40,380
But even then, I mean, if it just scrolls the right things, it says bias, blah blah blah blah, authenticating, initializing, enterprise, you don't know.

203
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:51,820
So, I'm not trying to cause panic here, but you should be aware that, so you have a little more sure when your computer is doing a cold boot, right?

204
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,540
Because it's functionally like turned off, although that's a whole other story.

205
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,180
How do you know your device is turned off?

206
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,360
We will touch upon this in a couple of days.

207
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:10,120
You often tell it to turn off, you press the button, and how do you know it's off?

208
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,560
Well, you say, well, you know what, I'll just unplug it from the wall.

209
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,900
Are you sure that's on?

210
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,980
Are you sure there's no battery?

211
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,980
Do you know what's inside the device?

212
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,240
They have CMOS battery, too.

213
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,160
Ah, yeah, but you should like disassembling the device, voiding the warranty, and causing electric shock, potentially.

214
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,160
So, actually, you don't.

215
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,640
So, that's a depressing thought, right?

216
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,420
You actually don't know who is asking for the password.

217
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,720
But we trust.

218
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,180
Okay, but that's the password that goes to your operating system, right?

219
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,420
It doesn't go on the wire, right?

220
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,620
It's not sent anywhere.

221
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:56,240
What about if you're logging into Facebook, or, you know, your Instagram, or whatever, your favorite website, or any kind of service?

222
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,820
Like, you're going into UCI.

223
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,800
A window pops up that looks like UCI's little pop-up, with blue and stuff, you know, all the right colors.

224
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,600
How busy is this to copy?

225
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,680
So, you enter your password, and then it goes.

226
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,700
So, you don't know.

227
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,480
But let's suspend our disbelief, and say, okay, we trust that it goes, it goes to the right place, okay, okay, okay.

228
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,200
But what about how is it sent?

229
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,680
Is it sent in clear text?

230
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,620
That's bad, right?

231
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,280
It can't be sent in clear text, because then it gets used to the other part.

232
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,500
Okay, well, you hope that actually in reality, it sends over a secure connection.

233
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:45,100
And sort of prior to you entering the password, whatever the stub application, whether it's a browser, a client browser, or some other application on your laptop, or your phone,

234
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:52,080
has already established a secure, usually TLS, or VPN connection, to the other end.

235
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,700
But even then, you might not trust that connection.

236
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:05,820
So, probably not a good idea to send the password unencrypted, even over the connection.

237
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,420
So, what's typically done is the password is, like, hashed.

238
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,220
Remember hash functions, right?

239
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,520
Yeah.

240
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,600
Now the question is, where is it hashed?

241
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,800
So, who gets to see your password locally?

242
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,400
Maybe it's hashed in software, with a client software.

243
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,300
Maybe it's hashed in hardware.

244
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,960
Maybe there's a way for the login prompt, or if it presents you with a password prompt,

245
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,780
to communicate directly to some hardware inside your laptop of a smartphone,

246
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
that actually takes that password, hashes it, and that's it.

247
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,700
And then there's a template resistant, because if it's not, maybe, you know, somebody can hack it.

248
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,280
And then, how does the other end check the password?

249
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,540
Well, and of course, is your password guessable?

250
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,380
Right?

251
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,420
None of this other stuff is important if your password is weak.

252
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,520
Right?

253
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,220
If I can, with reasonable probability, guess your password,

254
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,740
all the other measures to prevent theft and misuse of password, they're useless.

255
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,320
Because guessing a password means somebody is going to try to log in, just like you would.

256
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,980
So, whatever measures are taken after you enter a password and hit return,

257
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
they're useless if the password is being guessed.

258
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,280
Also, on most operating systems, it's difficult to keep a password file secret.

259
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,920
Especially like multi-user systems.

260
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,180
So, I know that you are all used to, essentially, single-user computers, right?

261
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,160
I mean, how many people usually have, like, multiple profiles on their Android?

262
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,980
I mean, you can do it, but it's a pain.

263
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,340
How many of you share your laptop with others?

264
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,320
My guess is not many, if any.

265
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,700
Maybe when you were younger, and you had, like, a sibling, and you shared your laptop.

266
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,700
Or the parent will let you use their laptop and create an account.

267
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,460
But most people, like, you're 80, they don't share laptops.

268
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,600
So, this does not seem relevant to you, but think about a bigger world out there.

269
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,180
Like, an organization.

270
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,100
Where you have multiple users, multiple, many users,

271
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,460
and they all need to log in and access the same system.

272
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:29,540
So, you need to store the password database somewhere, the password file, right?

273
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,100
And so, in modern systems, at least one of the Unix derived,

274
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,980
historically, the password file is accessible.

275
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
It's called world-readable.

276
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,920
And the reason it's world-readable is because it's not just the password file.

277
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,820
It's, essentially, the user database.

278
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:55,840
And so, programs that run on Linux, or Unix, and whatever,

279
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,700
all these Unix-derived operating systems,

280
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,940
they need to consult that file, not for the password's sake,

281
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:08,360
but for account's sake, to figure out what accounts have rights for what resources.

282
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,900
So, it's mostly for access control.

283
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:11,920
Okay?

284
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,680
This was done a long time ago, when Unix first was born, in the 80s.

285
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,020
Now, with hard-to-remember passwords,

286
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,700
if you don't pick a weak password, you pick a hard-to-remember password, you're good.

287
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,480
And if your memory is good, wonderful.

288
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,360
But what about reusing passwords?

289
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,640
A lot of people can remember one difficult password.

290
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,060
Right?

291
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,500
I'm sure you can remember one difficult password.

292
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,680
That is not, by any standard, weak.

293
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,260
But then, can you remember 10, 15?

294
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,800
These days, most of us have well over 10,

295
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,980
some of us, I would say, around 20 different accounts.

296
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,040
There have been some studies about this, but I don't think it's an immediate number.

297
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:06,880
You could carry around an object, like some kind of a device, like a smartphone,

298
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,520
maybe, that has your passwords all stored there in plain text.

299
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,940
And you unlock your phone, you access your password, and you're like, oh, great.

300
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,440
What if you don't have your phone?

301
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,060
What if somebody steals your phone?

302
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,780
What if a malicious app on the phone exfiltrated that file?

303
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,040
So there is a cottage industry out there called, you know, Password Vault.

304
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,980
Maybe, have anybody used Password Vault?

305
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,540
I mean, some of them are, there are some free, but most of them are cost-mine.

306
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,380
And some companies do use those.

307
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,220
Okay, but guess what?

308
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,340
Well, when you have a company that runs the services, Password Vault Vault,

309
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,960
a third-party Password Vault Vault, they become like honey or a swarm of bees.

310
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,080
They are a super attractive attack target, and just like this DA that we talked about last time,

311
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,880
it's like, attack me.

312
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,420
Because this is where the friendly jewels are.

313
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,880
You get into a password-drawn company, you get into their databases,

314
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,280
whether through outside or inside attack, and you wind up with a big dirt.

315
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,380
Big prize, right?

316
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,380
Tons of passwords.

317
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,100
So I'm not clear that that's a good solution.

318
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,140
Then there's like denial of service issues, right?

319
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,100
If you store your passwords on your phone, if the phone is lost,

320
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,420
or like what happened to me a couple of months ago,

321
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,820
the phone just died, and there's no way.

322
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,740
I mean, it's dead beyond all salvation.

323
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,020
There's no way you can take anything out.

324
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,220
So now it's stuck with having to change all the passwords.

325
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,400
It's like a denial of service.

326
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,980
And for a while, your account's essentially off-limits to you.

327
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,520
One of the more interesting and super easy attacks, by the way,

328
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,280
with a denial of service goal.

329
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,900
Let's say you want to attack a particular company, right?

330
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,020
Let's say you have a company called XYZ Incorporated

331
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:05,280
that provides access to, I don't know, cute squirrel videos.

332
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,400
And they specialize in cute squirrels only.

333
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,760
No ugly squirrels.

334
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,140
And all the squirrel lovers in the world create accounts there

335
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,320
and just love, you know, it's like popular, right?

336
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,920
So all this community, probably not large,

337
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,460
because how many squirrel lovers out there,

338
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,980
they actively use this service,

339
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,780
and then somebody who wants to just piss them off

340
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,000
or maybe has a competing company decides to mount it in our service.

341
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,760
All they need to do is not break any passwords.

342
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,220
All they need to do is get a large enough sample of the usernames

343
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,420
or people who have an account.

344
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,520
All you do, you can program this.

345
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,980
You can run into this by hand.

346
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,620
Essentially, try to log in.

347
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,820
So for every account, let's say Alice has an account.

348
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,880
Write the username Alice, random password, click.

349
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,920
Username Bob, random password, click.

350
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,460
Do it three times, do it four times,

351
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,580
whatever the little threshold.

352
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,820
Use it, it's a little threshold.

353
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,760
For number of failed logins, right?

354
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,480
What happens?

355
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,700
You're locked out.

356
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,900
So when real users come back to log in,

357
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:21,020
due to the large number of successive failed login attempts,

358
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,400
you need to contact this 1-800 number in Mauritania.

359
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,620
Good luck.

360
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,200
With awful hours.

361
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,320
With, yes, of course.

362
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,180
We're only open between 3.30 and 4.30 p.m. Hawaii time.

363
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:32,980
Good luck.

364
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,620
Good luck, right?

365
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,500
Because then, of course, they want to make sure it's you.

366
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,580
Even if it's done in automated fashion

367
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,980
with some other second factor,

368
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,880
all back email, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

369
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,560
It's a giant waste of time.

370
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,800
And a logistical nightmare.

371
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,040
So, a great attack.

372
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,520
You can program a bot to do this, right?

373
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,540
You can go for, like, even random usernames.

374
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,440
Eventually, you're going to find usernames that are existing.

375
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,960
Login, login, login.

376
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,520
Bam.

377
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,560
Locked out.

378
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,900
So, no passwords need to be broken.

379
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,260
So, let's see.

380
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,200
Then there's social engineering.

381
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,540
Social engineering is, like, this whole thing in its own right.

382
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,220
You can teach a class on that, just on social engineering.

383
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,880
But it's not really computer science.

384
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,140
Social engineering is all about how to trick people.

385
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,760
So, maybe more appropriate than psychology or some other department.

386
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,840
But it's a wonderful opportunity for attackers, right?

387
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,380
And a lot of spectacular hacks in this world that you've heard about

388
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,920
that sound really, really technical.

389
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,160
I suspect it's TouchNet and Mirai and all these other things.

390
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,280
I think they all, I'm pretty sure,

391
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,340
they all somehow involve elements of social engineering.

392
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
Social engineering means human.

393
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,000
Right?

394
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,500
Human interaction is elicitation of sensitive information

395
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,520
in verbal form.

396
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,660
Non-analog form.

397
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:04,800
Okay?

398
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,480
The typical social engineering attack

399
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,740
probably doesn't work at night today,

400
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,920
but, you know,

401
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,840
a CIO or a, let's say,

402
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,520
no, it's an IT person,

403
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,980
in the middle of the night,

404
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,860
in some department of some random company,

405
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,800
receives a panicked phone call

406
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,820
from the vice president

407
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,700
of, I don't know,

408
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,580
toilet affairs,

409
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,160
and says,

410
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,460
I am stuck in

411
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,540
Timbuktu

412
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,320
on a

413
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,440
very important company trip.

414
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,740
I'm dealing with clients.

415
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,160
All of a sudden,

416
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,640
my phone broke.

417
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,880
I cannot log in.

418
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,520
Help.

419
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,680
Millions of dollars

420
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,200
of business are at stake.

421
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,240
The panicked IT clerk,

422
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,580
who's sleepy,

423
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,200
and probably has,

424
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,380
I don't know,

425
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,520
DeVry Institute course

426
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,820
or education or something,

427
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,700
says,

428
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,800
oh, of course,

429
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,580
yes, sir.

430
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,760
And says,

431
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,120
okay,

432
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,700
here's a one-time login code,

433
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,300
go in this,

434
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,780
do this.

435
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,160
Yeah,

436
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,700
that's it.

437
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,780
That's the end of it.

438
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,160
That's the back door.

439
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,620
That allows the attacker

440
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,040
to get in.

441
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,560
It's still super common.

442
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,040
Yeah,

443
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,700
I'm sure,

444
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,100
you know,

445
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,560
every once in a while,

446
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,620
in a research literature,

447
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,940
or even at, like,

448
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,640
Black Hat,

449
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,180
DEFCON,

450
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,760
you will hear talks

451
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,420
about people saying,

452
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:21,740
okay,

453
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,760
we did this kind of

454
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,940
probing attack

455
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,100
against 500 companies

456
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,580
than, like,

457
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,000
Brazil,

458
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,800
I heard one talk.

459
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,500
And the particular talk

460
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,360
I heard is that,

461
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,620
you know,

462
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,540
when this was about

463
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,320
the attacks

464
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,560
on the Brazilian banks,

465
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,060
right,

466
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,220
and essentially utilizing

467
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,000
what I just described,

468
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,320
calling at random hours

469
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,700
and pretending to be somebody.

470
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,000
They didn't even invent somebody.

471
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,720
They actually pretended

472
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,200
to be somebody

473
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,100
who worked for the company.

474
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,140
So, you know,

475
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,560
the hackers know in advance.

476
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,480
They've done their research.

477
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:50,820
They've looked

478
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,700
for the company charts

479
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:51,960
and said,

480
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,880
who is awake?

481
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,140
Oh, this guy is on vacation.

482
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:54,820
So,

483
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,400
it is really believable

484
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,740
when most of it is true.

485
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,240
So, they call it,

486
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,420
say,

487
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,340
I'm so-and-so.

488
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,460
I'm on vacation

489
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,340
in Florida.

490
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:04,940
Oh,

491
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,020
so-and-so.

492
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,420
Yes,

493
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,160
he's on vacation.

494
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,840
Element of truth

495
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,680
goes a long way.

496
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,460
Right?

497
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,020
That's kind of

498
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,740
human psychology.

499
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,860
It works.

500
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,040
In the U.S.,

501
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,800
there were studies that,

502
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,380
oh, you know,

503
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,460
just like infomercials.

504
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:18,720
I don't know

505
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,260
if you even know

506
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,280
what infomercials are,

507
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,980
but this is a curious thing.

508
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
When Americans listen

509
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,560
to a voice

510
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,040
of a salesman,

511
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,000
it helps

512
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,920
if their voice

513
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,720
has a refined British accent.

514
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,040
Maybe you should wonder why.

515
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,640
If somebody speaks like they're

516
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,520
from the deep south,

517
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,480
forget it.

518
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,980
If somebody speaks like they're

519
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,040
from Brooklyn,

520
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,000
forget it.

521
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,260
But if somebody speaks

522
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,040
with a refined British accent,

523
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,700
carefully enunciating

524
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,980
every single syllable,

525
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,520
I'll do every single word

526
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,100
they say.

527
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,220
Most of us,

528
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,520
this country,

529
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,760
oh, yes,

530
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,240
I'm you.

531
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,240
What can I do?

532
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,520
Right?

533
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,700
So that's part

534
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,420
of social engineering.

535
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,140
Right?

536
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,540
So,

537
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,740
another reason is,

538
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,760
another way that it works

539
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,240
is the attacker

540
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,280
will know some information

541
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,900
about you.

542
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,180
Right?

543
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,480
So if they want to impersonate you

544
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
or want to get into your account,

545
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,220
they will know information.

546
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,820
Social security numbers,

547
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,560
days of birth,

548
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
those are a lot of difficult

549
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,000
things to find out.

550
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,240
Right?

551
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,160
Social security numbers

552
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,420
used to be believed

553
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,040
to be secret.

554
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,740
Nobody believes

555
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,820
to be secret in these days.

556
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,320
Even though we still

557
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,100
keep them private,

558
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,700
but I can buy

559
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,740
your social security number

560
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,500
if you have one.

561
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,100
It's not going to cost me

562
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,600
very much.

563
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,100
And so if I buy it,

564
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,780
even if it costs me

565
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,660
a couple hundred dollars,

566
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,260
it allows me essentially,

567
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,100
well,

568
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,240
not just social security,

569
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,100
but along with

570
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,700
other information

571
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,460
like David Burr,

572
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,320
driving the last time

573
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,580
in December,

574
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,660
maybe open a bank account

575
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,420
online.

576
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,060
Great.

577
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,460
If I open a bank account,

578
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,400
I can rent something

579
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:49,960
in your name.

580
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,540
Like an apartment.

581
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,620
Establish a gas company

582
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,880
relationship.

583
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,900
Electrical company.

584
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,220
Right?

585
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,760
Essentially,

586
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,320
start stealing your identity.

587
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,480
Yeah,

588
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:03,920
so,

589
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,220
this is like entertainment,

590
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,440
but anyway,

591
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,260
passwords are a pain.

592
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,120
So we're going to focus

593
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,640
for a moment

594
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,300
on the passwords.

595
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,680
There have been

596
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,520
tons of breaches

597
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:17,900
in the middle,

598
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,340
but by the way,

599
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,080
this is super old.

600
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,880
All these examples

601
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,480
are super old,

602
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:20,980
and yet,

603
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,560
I don't refresh them.

604
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,060
They're like 20 years old.

605
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:25,640
But,

606
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,100
this happens every year.

607
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,700
The similar things

608
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,500
that happened

609
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:30,820
20,

610
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,700
25 years ago

611
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,360
still happen.

612
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,040
Right?

613
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,860
If you go to the

614
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,920
website,

615
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,020
passwordpresearch.com,

616
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,620
they have lots

617
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,080
of interesting

618
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,420
articles.

619
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,280
Right?

620
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,620
So,

621
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,660
why do people

622
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,300
want your password?

623
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:47,780
So,

624
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,160
of course,

625
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,000
one of the reasons

626
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,940
they may want your password

627
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,800
is just to log in

628
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,820
and just delete your files.

629
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,640
They just hate you

630
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,460
and they want to

631
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,820
suck.

632
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,600
That doesn't happen

633
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,020
very often.

634
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,720
It can.

635
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,220
I mean,

636
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,700
you make some enemies,

637
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,560
you probably can.

638
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,000
But,

639
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,780
this is very personal.

640
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,320
Generally,

641
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,120
what somebody wants

642
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,860
is more than just

643
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,260
your password.

644
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:07,640
So,

645
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,220
installing a key log

646
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,760
or a sniffer

647
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,420
is another way.

648
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,600
And then,

649
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,360
basically,

650
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,220
you sniff for more passwords.

651
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,520
Especially if your account,

652
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,740
getting into your account,

653
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,300
is privileged.

654
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:20,600
Right?

655
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:20,780
So,

656
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,680
maybe it will be able

657
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,840
to run a sniffer

658
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,460
that will sniff

659
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,420
on other people's passwords.

660
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,420
The other thing

661
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,660
is to steal the password file.

662
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,000
And once you steal

663
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,800
the password file,

664
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,020
well,

665
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,720
then you can run

666
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,860
password cracking too much.

667
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,860
Because the password file,

668
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,820
as you can already imagine,

669
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,860
doesn't actually store

670
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,540
a real password,

671
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,480
but stores hashes.

672
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:41,800
Right?

673
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:41,980
So,

674
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,680
all you need to do

675
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,740
is try a brute force adapt.

676
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,060
Alright?

677
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,420
So,

678
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,820
Unix-style passwords

679
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,460
work like this,

680
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:54,680
right?

681
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,920
You enter your password,

682
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,940
it hashes,

683
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,760
and then this is

684
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,300
the etc.

685
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,780
etc. password file

686
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,040
that has one line

687
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,580
for a user,

688
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,060
generally,

689
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,020
and it contains,

690
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,860
among other things,

691
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,480
so the line,

692
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,000
the one line is like,

693
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,660
it's a text file.

694
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,200
So,

695
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,540
one line for a record,

696
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,060
oh,

697
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,440
one line is a record,

698
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,140
and this record

699
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,180
is for a given user,

700
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,440
and it has some

701
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,600
non-human accounts,

702
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:16,980
okay?

703
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,340
net, like root,

704
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,740
and admin,

705
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,200
or whatever,

706
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,780
some other,

707
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,020
some other cron account,

708
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,540
but it also has one

709
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,220
for every user.

710
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,020
And so,

711
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,020
when you enter a username,

712
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,420
the username is also

713
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,340
stored there in the clear.

714
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,240
So,

715
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,140
people realized early on

716
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,260
that it's not a good idea

717
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,040
to store a password there,

718
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,340
so why don't we store a hash?

719
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,680
So,

720
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,320
great,

721
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,360
the system doesn't know

722
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,960
your password,

723
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,880
it only knows the hash,

724
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,680
and because,

725
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,680
presumably,

726
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,100
we use a good cryptographic hash,

727
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,020
like the kind we talked about

728
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,120
briefly last time,

729
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,680
hash is supposed to be

730
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,560
one way.

731
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:58,820
Yeah?

732
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,300
One way means that,

733
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,940
yeah,

734
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,820
the inverting,

735
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,880
like knowing a hash,

736
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,440
and learning what the input

737
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,340
to the hash was,

738
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,540
is hard.

739
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
But is it really?

740
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,040
If the input space

741
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,840
is very large,

742
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,640
it is hard.

743
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,240
But if the input space

744
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,360
is constricted,

745
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,200
it might not be so hard.

746
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,980
But wait,

747
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,560
there's more.

748
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,020
Hashing is better

749
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,560
than encryption,

750
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,900
maybe you will realize why.

751
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:27,840
You know why?

752
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,520
I mean,

753
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,760
encrypting a block,

754
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,740
it should be,

755
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,280
it's usually roughly equivalent

756
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,180
to hashing a block.

757
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,360
All you think encryption

758
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,540
is not used.

759
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,460
And hashing is used.

760
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,100
No decryption.

761
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,680
No decryption.

762
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,940
Yeah,

763
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,960
that's a reason,

764
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,640
it's not that.

765
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,640
Major reason.

766
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,200
I hope you've never

767
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,300
had to see the thing

768
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,100
that's passed through

769
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,200
and that's been honest.

770
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,300
Okay,

771
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,140
now you're getting close.

772
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,460
What else does encryption

773
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,420
mean?

774
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,880
You want to encrypt the question.

775
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,040
No,

776
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,060
it leaks the length,

777
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,520
doesn't it?

778
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,160
Hmm.

779
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,460
So you want to have

780
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,220
the uniform

781
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,320
value,

782
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:21,860
right?

783
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,380
There are other reasons,

784
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,300
then you can think of some.

785
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,820
Encryption is not,

786
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,640
now encryption,

787
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,000
that's,

788
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,080
let me rephrase

789
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,520
what I said,

790
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,120
be very careful.

791
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Encryption as in

792
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,380
something that can be reversed

793
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,520
is not used.

794
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,820
You can use encryption

795
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,820
to build a hash function.

796
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,840
An encryption function

797
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,460
can be used

798
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,260
to build a hash function.

799
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,320
Okay,

800
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,100
so it's okay

801
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,320
to use encryption function

802
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,420
to build a hash function

803
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,080
that you can use

804
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,660
for this purpose.

805
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,900
But what we don't do

806
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,760
is encrypt

807
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,880
the password itself.

808
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,120
Okay?

809
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,100
So remember the

810
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,220
properties of hash functions,

811
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,520
right?

812
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,240
So if you are a password hacker

813
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,120
and you want to

814
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,060
break the password,

815
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,180
what property

816
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:04,740
would you like

817
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,540
the hash function

818
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,280
not to have?

819
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,140
Well,

820
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,580
one way is we agree.

821
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,540
We all must have,

822
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:12,740
right?

823
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,740
Because it should be

824
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,720
difficult to go back

825
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,820
and figure out

826
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,460
from the hash

827
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,080
what the password

828
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,500
is going to be.

829
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,960
But what about

830
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,560
these other things?

831
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,040
Remember,

832
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,700
there's a strong

833
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,720
collision resistance

834
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,640
and weak collision resistance.

835
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,360
Which do we care

836
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,040
about?

837
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,460
Yeah.

838
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,340
Strong

839
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,820
would be nice to have

840
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,560
but not super important

841
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,200
because

842
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,020
the password

843
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,000
is specific,

844
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,240
right?

845
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,720
It's given.

846
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,860
It's given

847
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,440
to the hacker

848
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,860
but it's fixed

849
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,480
by the hash,

850
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,100
right?

851
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,420
So in order

852
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,480
to break

853
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,220
the system

854
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,800
without learning

855
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,360
the password,

856
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,920
the hacker

857
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,640
has to find

858
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,760
another password

859
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,280
that hashes

860
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,320
into the same value.

861
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,240
Does that make sense?

862
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,700
So if your password

863
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,360
is Apple

864
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,660
and it hashes

865
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:01,920
into

866
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,620
345

867
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,800
and I pick

868
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,100
Pear

869
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,940
and it also

870
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,480
hashes into

871
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,020
the 345

872
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,760
I don't need

873
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,060
to know

874
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,520
Apple.

875
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,960
I can just

876
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,620
log into your account

877
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,460
by typing Pear.

878
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,380
OK?

879
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,880
So

880
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,520
that weak collision

881
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:19,860
resistance

882
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,760
and that's

883
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,200
what we need.

884
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,480
So

885
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,140
I'm not sure

886
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,380
how many

887
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,020
to do it

888
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,680
but historically

889
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,160
that's what

890
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,660
has been done

891
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,740
is that

892
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,320
Linux

893
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,040
was using

894
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,520
DES

895
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,940
encryption

896
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,420
as a hash

897
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:39,700
function.

898
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,760
Now how

899
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,420
does it do it?

900
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:41,960
Well,

901
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,460
it takes

902
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,100
a null

903
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,580
string

904
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,580
a 64-bit

905
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,620
now you remember

906
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,360
DES is a 64-bit block

907
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,320
so it takes

908
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,380
a string of

909
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:50,620
0

910
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,500
64-bits

911
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:51,840
long

912
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,780
and then

913
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,780
encrypts it

914
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,400
repeatedly

915
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,120
OK?

916
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,180
Repeatedly

917
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,160
25 times

918
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,800
using

919
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,880
a DES

920
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,240
key

921
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,900
that is

922
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,260
derived

923
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,560
from the

924
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,880
password.

925
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,220
OK?

926
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,260
Make sense?

927
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,920
So it converts

928
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,460
your password

929
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,320
into a key

930
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,720
now that's

931
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,080
also

932
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,060
an interesting

933
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,380
detail

934
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:12,820
because

935
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
DES keys

936
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,280
are actually

937
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,180
56-bits

938
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,560
long

939
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
I mean

940
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,180
they're 64

941
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:17,860
but 8-bits

942
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,680
are parity-bits

943
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,460
so

944
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,500
that's an

945
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,140
interesting one

946
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,100
so we'll come

947
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,560
back to that

948
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,100
in a second.

949
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,140
The idea

950
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,720
so why do

951
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,380
they do this

952
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,200
or why did

953
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,840
they do this

954
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,180
because in

955
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,640
order to

956
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,460
mount a

957
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,960
brute force

958
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,340
attack

959
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:34,980
on a password

960
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,360
you would

961
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,680
have to

962
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,060
guess the

963
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,520
password

964
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,280
and perform

965
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,460
25

966
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,480
encryptions

967
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,720
or

968
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,380
if you like

969
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:45,840
25

970
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,300
decryptions

971
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,700
and at

972
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,160
the end

973
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,800
OK?

974
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,840
If you

975
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,420
hit 0

976
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,580
if what

977
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,120
you decrypt

978
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,920
after 25

979
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,480
decryptions

980
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:55,940
and 0

981
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,280
and a

982
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,620
string of

983
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:56,960
0s

984
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,520
you guessed

985
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:57,960
correctly.

986
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,400
OK?

987
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,600
Or

988
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,240
alternatively

989
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:03,540
you would

990
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:03,820
take

991
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,400
a string

992
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,960
of 0s

993
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,080
and encrypt

994
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,600
it 25

995
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,060
times

996
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,760
and see

997
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,100
if that

998
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,460
matches

999
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,020
the result

1000
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,300
in the

1001
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:09,600
password

1002
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:09,940
file.

1003
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:11,660
Am I

1004
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,000
with you?

1005
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:12,960
Any

1006
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,260
questions?

1007
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,620
So

1008
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,100
it's a

1009
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,660
clever idea

1010
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:16,900
right?

1011
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,260
The idea

1012
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,640
was to

1013
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,220
slow down

1014
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,380
the

1015
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,680
attacker

1016
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,320
25

1017
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,120
that is

1018
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,620
for every

1019
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,100
guess

1020
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,700
of a

1021
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,060
password

1022
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,780
or every

1023
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,880
possible

1024
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,280
password

1025
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,680
the attacker

1026
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,040
guesses

1027
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,240
it would

1028
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,540
have to

1029
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,120
perform

1030
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,280
25

1031
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,320
encryption

1032
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,980
or decryption

1033
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,460
operations.

1034
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,460
that's

1035
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:34,820
a lot

1036
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,940
and back

1037
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,380
then

1038
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,400
DESC was

1039
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:37,820
implemented

1040
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,300
mostly in

1041
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:38,620
hardware

1042
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:38,900
it was

1043
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,320
very slow

1044
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,800
in software

1045
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,680
so it

1046
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,180
seemed like

1047
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:41,700
a good idea.

1048
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,680
And then

1049
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,380
of course

1050
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,360
passwords aren't

1051
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,020
really random

1052
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,380
right?

1053
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,700
Doesn't matter

1054
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,080
how old you

1055
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,580
are, doesn't

1056
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,040
matter what

1057
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,620
culture

1058
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,140
or which

1059
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,600
country

1060
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,040
which

1061
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,940
ethnicity

1062
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,560
you come

1063
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:53,920
from

1064
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,040
within the

1065
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,540
group that

1066
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:55,960
you come

1067
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,240
from

1068
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,280
you're

1069
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,900
likely to

1070
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,300
pick a

1071
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,680
password

1072
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,000
that is

1073
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,280
not

1074
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:00,520
truly

1075
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:00,920
random.

1076
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,280
There's

1077
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:02,680
no such

1078
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,100
thing as

1079
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,460
humans

1080
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:03,780
picking

1081
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,540
truly

1082
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:04,920
random

1083
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,300
passwords.

1084
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,140
Even if

1085
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,460
you say

1086
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:06,780
well

1087
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,660
I know

1088
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,480
a certain

1089
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:09,940
date

1090
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,780
where

1091
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,100
let's

1092
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,440
say

1093
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,700
I

1094
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:12,800
don't

1095
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,060
know

1096
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,140
I

1097
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,660
graduated

1098
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,040
from

1099
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,520
college

1100
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:16,960
or

1101
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,440
I

1102
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,020
had

1103
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,180
my

1104
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,480
first

1105
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:18,980
date

1106
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,380
or

1107
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,880
something

1108
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,760
auspicious

1109
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,260
happened

1110
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:22,520
on a

1111
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:22,840
particular

1112
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,140
date

1113
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,080
and

1114
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,400
nobody

1115
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:24,620
else

1116
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:24,860
knows

1117
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,080
it

1118
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,700
just

1119
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:25,980
you

1120
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,120
you

1121
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,340
think

1122
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,560
that

1123
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:27,760
might

1124
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:27,900
be

1125
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,220
random

1126
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,440
but

1127
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:28,700
actually

1128
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:28,880
it's

1129
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,140
not.

1130
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:31,640
I

1131
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:31,880
think

1132
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,080
about

1133
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,560
are

1134
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:32,860
dates

1135
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,140
really

1136
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,480
random?

1137
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:34,680
There's

1138
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:34,880
a lot

1139
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:34,980
of

1140
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,160
people

1141
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,420
use

1142
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:35,580
them

1143
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,040
professionally.

1144
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,720
Think

1145
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:37,900
about

1146
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,100
how

1147
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,260
we

1148
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:38,600
structure

1149
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,020
dates.

1150
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,580
Forget

1151
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,200
hours

1152
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,380
a

1153
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:42,520
minute

1154
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:42,780
just

1155
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,120
dates.

1156
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:44,740
I

1157
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:44,860
mean

1158
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,180
depending

1159
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,340
on

1160
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,200
which

1161
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,600
notation

1162
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:46,780
it

1163
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,020
used

1164
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,140
to

1165
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,280
them

1166
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,400
in

1167
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:47,500
the

1168
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:47,700
United

1169
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,040
States

1170
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,220
we

1171
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,460
use

1172
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,280
month

1173
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,860
day

1174
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,440
year

1175
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,940
right?

1176
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,680
How

1177
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:52,860
many

1178
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,140
months

1179
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,280
are

1180
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,500
there?

1181
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,180
Well

1182
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,000
last time I

1183
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,220
said

1184
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,220
how many

1185
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:58,680
days are

1186
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:58,880
there?

1187
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,480
Let's be

1188
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,100
generous and

1189
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,700
say 51

1190
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,100
in every

1191
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,380
month

1192
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:01,700
right?

1193
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:02,720
They're

1194
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:02,980
honest

1195
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,300
right?

1196
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,160
Let's say

1197
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,400
they're

1198
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,720
out because

1199
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,020
they're

1200
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,540
the maximum

1201
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,760
and how many

1202
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,280
years is it?

1203
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:07,700
Well

1204
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,140
there are a lot

1205
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,580
of years

1206
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,940
but you're not

1207
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,800
likely to pick

1208
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,580
a year from

1209
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,040
dark ages

1210
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,280
history

1211
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,300
history

1212
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,680
and

1213
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,360
yeah

1214
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,240
if you're

1215
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:17,560
a fan

1216
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:17,920
of history

1217
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,320
you might

1218
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,560
pick

1219
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:18,880
something

1220
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,460
ancient

1221
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:22,900
Egyptian

1222
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,280
era

1223
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,580
or

1224
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,340
something

1225
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:24,800
from

1226
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,620
the

1227
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:25,880
time

1228
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,120
of

1229
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,020
William

1230
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,200
the

1231
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,700
Conqueror

1232
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:27,960
but

1233
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,980
most of

1234
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,120
us

1235
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,400
would pick

1236
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,680
something

1237
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,080
reasonably

1238
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,420
more

1239
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,060
1940

1240
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,720
21st

1241
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,020
century

1242
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,420
so

1243
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:32,600
that

1244
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:32,920
does not

1245
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,100
be

1246
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,400
vulnerable

1247
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,280
that's

1248
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,540
not

1249
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,000
random

1250
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,740
and the

1251
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,100
space

1252
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,380
of that

1253
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:37,500
is

1254
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:37,740
very

1255
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,100
small

1256
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,640
so

1257
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:39,820
don't

1258
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:39,980
pick

1259
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,260
dates

1260
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,020
in any

1261
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,340
format

1262
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,720
right

1263
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:43,920
so

1264
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,160
but if

1265
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,440
you just

1266
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:44,780
look at

1267
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,000
the

1268
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,860
52

1269
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,380

1270
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:46,560

1271
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:46,840

1273
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:47,820
letters

1274
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,440
that is

1275
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:49,640
being

1276
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,040
generous

1277
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,440
assuming

1278
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,740
that

1279
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,120
whatever

1280
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,520
system

1281
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:51,720
we're

1282
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,960
working

1283
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,800
distinguishes

1284
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,160
between

1285

because

1290
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,540
some

1291
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,620
systems

1292
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:55,860
do

1293
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,120
not

1294
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,600
right

1295
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,520
they'll

1296
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:57,760
just

1297
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,420
convert

1298
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:58,800
everything

1299
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,000
to

1300
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,180

1336
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,620
the dot

1337
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,020
and maybe

1338
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,760
that's it

1339
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,820
but okay

1340
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,200
let's be

1341
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,560
generous

1342
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,840
so that

1343
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,300
gives us

1344
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:25,740
52

1345
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,340
plus 10

1346
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,040
plus 32

1347
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,500
that's

1348
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,980
94

1349
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,180
and let's

1350
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,560
say we

1351
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,040
limit to

1352
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,720
8 characters

1353
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,600
because

1354
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,720
that's

1355
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,200
pretty much

1356
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,880
how many

1357
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,120
of you

1358
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,300
have

1359
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:38,760
passwords

1360
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,200
that I

1361
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,560
exceed

1362
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,220
8 characters

1363
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,940
yeah

1364
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,880
I buy

1365
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,240
a lot

1366
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,060
how many

1367
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,580
exceed

1368
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,340
12 characters

1369
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,520
look at

1370
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:48,720
you

1371
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,500
15

1372
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,780
okay

1373
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,260
you like

1374
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:54,560
entering

1375
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,000
passwords

1376
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,420
don't you

1377
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,400
because

1378
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:56,760
there's

1379
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,060
a big

1380
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,460
trade-off

1381
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:57,700
here

1382
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,000
right

1383
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,020
the big

1384
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,520
trade-off

1385
00:40:59,520 --> 00:40:59,920
is

1386
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,840
okay

1387
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,100
so

1388
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,360
let's

1389
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,500
say

1390
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,180
I'm

1391
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,440
not going

1392
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,080
to

1393
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,720
triangulate

1394
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:04,920
your

1395
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,220
password

1396
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,500
here

1397
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,840
but let's

1398
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,100
say you

1399
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,240
have

1400
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,560
15

1401
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:07,900
character

1402
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,360
password

1403
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,300
and

1404
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,520
he has

1405
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:10,900
an 8

1406
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,340
character

1407
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:11,760
password

1408
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,900
now we

1409
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,020
have

1410
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,600
usability

1411
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,120
issue

1412
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,620
let's

1413
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:15,820
say

1414
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,100
you're

1415
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,500
young

1416
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,040
you're

1417
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,380
smart

1418
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:17,720
you can

1419
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,120
remember

1420
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,500
15

1421
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:18,820
characters

1422
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,380
obviously

1423
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:19,820
you can

1424
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,060
right

1425
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,300
but what

1426
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:23,480
about

1427
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:23,780
making

1428
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,420
mistakes

1429
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,580
in

1430
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:25,740
those

1431
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,020
15

1432
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,440
characters

1433
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,780
as you

1434
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,060
type

1435
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,900
have

1436
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,020
we

1437
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,220
never

1438
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,420
did

1439
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:29,840
mistakes

1440
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,840
right

1441
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,580
how likely

1442
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:34,980
let's

1443
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,380
put it

1444
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,720
another way

1445
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,260
how likely

1446
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:36,440
are you

1447
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:36,700
to make

1448
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,100
a mistake

1449
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,380
in an

1450
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:37,540
8

1451
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:37,880
character

1452
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,280
password

1453
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,760
as opposed

1454
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:38,980
to a

1455
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,220
15

1456
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,580
character

1457
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:39,960
password

1458
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,820
much more

1459
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,120
likely

1460
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,680
there are

1461
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:42,860
some

1462
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,100
people

1463
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,700
fatigued

1464
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:43,920
right

1465
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,260
I mean

1466
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:44,820
finger

1467
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,260
fatigued

1468
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,660
you have

1469
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,060
to stare

1470
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,260
at the

1471
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:46,500
keyword

1472
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,600
so

1473
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:47,880
there's

1474
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,160
that

1475
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,480
second

1476
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:49,780
issue

1477
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,100
is the

1478
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,460
time

1479
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,380
it just

1480
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:51,580
takes

1481
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:51,940
longer

1482
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,400
to enter

1483
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,620
that

1484
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:53,940
password

1485
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,980
so

1486
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,360
while I

1487
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,100
find it

1488
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,580
commendable

1489
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:58,920
that you

1490
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,360
guys use

1491
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,800
this long

1492
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,220
password

1493
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,700
that's

1494
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,000
great

1495
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,480
that doesn't

1496
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:03,860
mean you're

1497
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,200
out of the

1498
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,440
woods

1499
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,020
with attacks

1500
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,900
you know

1501
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,600
but

1502
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,840
there is a

1503
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,220
trade-off

1504
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:08,700
right

1505
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,140
and most

1506
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,400
people

1507
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:09,800
I mean

1508
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,480
they're okay

1509
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:10,900
with like

1510
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,540
not super

1511
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:11,860
short

1512
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,220
passwords

1513
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,060
but like

1514
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:13,660
research

1515
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,280
show that

1516
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:14,660
8 is

1517
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:14,980
about

1518
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,160
the right

1519
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,540
mix

1520
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,680
but with

1521
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:17,860
8

1522
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,140
characters

1523
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,800
which is

1524
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,240
I think

1525
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:19,780
for most

1526
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,100
people

1527
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,880
and I

1528
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,240
suspect

1529
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,780
most people

1530
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,240
your age

1531
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,640
have picked

1532
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,220
some better

1533
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:23,680
passwords

1534
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,160
than let's

1535
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,500
say your

1536
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:24,880
uncles

1537
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,000
and grandparents

1538
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,020
and parents

1539
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,440
because you

1540
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:28,580
know

1541
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,320
who are less

1542
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,720
confused

1543
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,040
having

1544
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,760
you're going

1545
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,240
to wind up

1546
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,400
with roughly

1547
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,560
6 quadrillion

1548
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,680
possible passwords

1549
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,060
well to a

1550
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,520
kid this

1551
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,120
sounds really

1552
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,620
impressive

1553
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:38,980
right

1554
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,380
you just

1555
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:39,960
explain how

1556
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,420
many zeros

1557
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:40,720
are

1558
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,360
but we're

1559
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:41,880
all adults

1560
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,160
here

1561
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,100
6 quadrillion

1562
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,580
is not a

1563
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,080
large number

1564
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,100
okay

1565
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,000
not at all

1566
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,480
right

1567
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,580
and

1568
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,120
since

1569
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,240
given

1570
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,620
freedom

1571
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,140
to pick

1572
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,380
right

1573
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,000
without like

1574
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,620
actual

1575
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,160
restriction

1576
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,900
most of us

1577
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,300
will pick

1578
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,040
things like

1579
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,900
human and

1580
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,500
pet names

1581
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,040
and dictionary

1582
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,500
words

1583
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,400
we're going to

1584
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:02,840
wind up

1585
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,200
with

1586
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,120
20

1587
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,020
2 to the

1588
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:06,340
20

1589
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,860
essentially

1590
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,480
a 20-bit

1591
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:07,840
password

1592
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,640
which means

1593
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:09,940
that

1594
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,780
even if

1595
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,160
your password

1596
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,520
is 8

1597
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:11,980
characters

1598
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,260
the real

1599
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,740
entropy

1600
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,060
there

1601
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:14,180
is

1602
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:14,360
about

1603
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:14,640
20

1604
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:14,920
minutes

1605
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,260
meaning

1606
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:19,580
that

1607
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,260
human

1608
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:20,760
death

1609
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,200
names

1610
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,580
and all

1611
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,180
the dictionary

1612
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:22,600
words

1613
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,160
will roughly

1614
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,620
be about

1615
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:23,900
2 to the

1616
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,060
point

1617
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,520
that's

1618
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:24,800
assuming

1619
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,240
the language

1620
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:25,660
is known

1621
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,200
so you

1622
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:26,440
assume

1623
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:26,860
your password

1624
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,800
is English

1625
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,180
like

1626
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,680
if you

1627
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:29,980
are

1628
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,220
Swahili

1629
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:31,720
speaker

1630
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,720
then a whole

1631
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,000
different

1632
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,260
thing

1633
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:33,700
will apply

1634
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,520
it will

1635
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,000
be based

1636
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,520
on the

1637
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,280
vocabulary

1638
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,720
of that

1639
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,000
language

1640
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,840
but

1641
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,000
you

1642
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,140
have

1643
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:38,240
to

1644
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:38,520
assume

1645
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:38,680
that

1646
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:38,900
hacker

1647
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,180
knows

1648
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:39,380
about

1649
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:39,520
that

1650
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,860
yeah

1651
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,460
so

1652
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,060
and

1653
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:44,280
if you

1654
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:44,460
think

1655
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:44,780
pins

1656
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:44,920
are

1657
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,200
better

1658
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,660
they're

1659
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,000
not

1660
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,080
because

1661
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,040
you

1662
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,540
get

1663
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,080
with

1664
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,900
maximum

1665
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,460
2 to the

1666
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:50,980
27

1667
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,520
with

1668
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:51,880
8

1669
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,340
digit

1670
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:52,800
pins

1671
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,200
and

1672
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,520
that's

1673
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:57,900
something

1674
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,260
that

1675
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:58,920
any

1676
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,040
software

1677
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,520
on your

1678
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:01,760
phone

1679
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,080
you can

1680
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,740
do

1681
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,180
in

1682
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,940
seconds

1683
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,340
just

1684
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:05,740
iterate

1685
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,140
for all

1686
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:06,380
of those

1687
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:06,580
so

1688
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:06,800
that's

1689
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,060
not a

1690
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,260
scary

1691
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:07,600
number

1692
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,440
on

1693
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:08,580
the

1694
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,080
websites

1695
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,940
they often

1696
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,780
restrict

1697
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,360
length

1698
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:11,640
for

1699
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,960
I get

1700
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,460
they have

1701
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:13,780
to store

1702
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,080
in a

1703
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,500
database

1704
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:14,860
somehow

1705
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,800
but why

1706
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,600
in the

1707
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:17,940
world

1708
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,300
would they

1709
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:18,580
ever

1710
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:18,780
that

1711
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,000
takes

1712
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,480
no sense

1713
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:19,800
to me

1714
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,000
either

1715
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,360
symbols

1716
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,200
they

1717
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,280
so

1718
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,860
I think

1719
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,380
the reason

1720
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:23,800
okay

1721
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,740
you're asking

1722
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,300
two questions

1723
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,140
why do they

1724
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,460
restrict

1725
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:26,800
the length

1726
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,540
and why

1727
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:27,920
they don't

1728
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,120
allow

1729
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,480
symbols

1730
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,920
none of

1731
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,320
those two

1732
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:30,680
none of

1733
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,000
those two

1734
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,480
make sense

1735
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:31,920
to me

1736
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,540
but I have

1737
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,320
a potential

1738
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:33,980
explanation

1739
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,040
for why

1740
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,220
they don't

1741
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:35,780
allow certain

1742
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,220
symbols

1743
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:36,720
is because

1744
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,320
they think

1745
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,040
these are

1746
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,600
executable

1747
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,020
some kind

1748
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:39,320
of like

1749
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:39,520
they're

1750
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,320
trigger symbols

1751
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,920
that somehow

1752
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,400
some of

1753
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,020
these things

1754
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,440
like

1755
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,480
slash slash

1756
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,200
or back

1757
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:48,700
slash back

1758
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,840
dollar sign

1759
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,560
can be used

1760
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,480
if you somehow

1761
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,380
cause a buffer

1762
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:53,960
overflow

1763
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,460
they can

1764
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,420
so there's

1765
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:56,820
some like

1766
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,560
suspicion

1767
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,920
of these symbols

1768
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,220
dating back years

1769
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:00,860
nobody really

1770
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,520
knows why

1771
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,520
but that's

1772
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,120
my suspicion

1773
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,900
why

1774
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,360
do they

1775
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,240
truncate

1776
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,080
and allow

1777
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,600
only

1778
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,680
fixed

1779
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,700
up to a certain

1780
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,020
number of

1781
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,220
characters

1782
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,860
I don't know

1783
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,140
that

1784
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,540
that may be

1785
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,280
it makes no

1786
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,060
sense because

1787
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,780
it's hashed

1788
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,820
and it may be

1789
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,460
again that

1790
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,440
whoever programmed

1791
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,280
the front end

1792
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,120
no

1793
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,860
they're also

1794
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,540
afraid of

1795
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,040
these kind

1796
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,440
of buffer

1797
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,100
overflows

1798
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,640
and so on

1799
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,120
and memory

1800
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,820
bugs

1801
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,920
because

1802
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,300
you allow

1803
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,120
unlimited number

1804
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:32,740
of characters

1805
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,300
they're thinking

1806
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:33,720
you're going to

1807
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,520
enter 2,000

1808
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,040
characters

1809
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,980
something is going

1810
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,340
to break

1811
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:36,800
in the code

1812
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,300
I know

1813
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:38,860
I know

1814
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,920
I'm with you

1815
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,240
on that

1816
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:40,960
I think that's

1817
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,240
silly

1818
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,460
right because

1819
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,240
there's no

1820
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:43,800
justification

1821
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,760
it's only the

1822
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,260
front end

1823
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,860
because of the

1824
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,380
back end

1825
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,400
they're hashed

1826
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:48,740
and they're all

1827
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,340
the same way

1828
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:58,280
it's a heat

1829
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,480
map

1830
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,400
some of the

1831
00:45:59,400 --> 00:45:59,980
stuff I'll show

1832
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,480
you is really

1833
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:00,880
dated

1834
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,300
dated as in

1835
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:02,940
like 10 years

1836
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,200
old

1837
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,820
more than 10

1838
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,060
years old

1839
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:04,660
none of it

1840
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:05,380
changed since

1841
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,120
people still

1842
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,500
think

1843
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,260
similar

1844
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:09,540
faster

1845
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,040
because the

1846
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:10,440
fundamental

1847
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,900
human

1848
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,040
mentality

1849
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,360
hasn't

1850
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:12,680
changed

1851
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,380
what is

1852
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:14,720
a heat

1853
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:14,900
map

1854
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,120
what does

1855
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,440
it mean

1856
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:15,920
is that

1857
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,500
you see

1858
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:16,840
where

1859
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,120
things are

1860
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,480
really

1861
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,480
hot

1862
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:19,700
there

1863
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,020
yellow

1864
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:20,500
right

1865
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,760
and so

1866
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,600
over here

1867
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,380
it's a heat

1868
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,020
map generated

1869
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,820
from a

1870
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,080
leaked

1871
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,560
password

1872
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,140
database

1873
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,460
a giant

1874
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:29,800
leaked

1875
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,200
password

1876
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:30,540
database

1877
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,520
okay

1878
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,240
so

1879
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,060
this is

1880
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,060
a pin

1881
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,400
sorry

1882
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:37,860
this is not

1883
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,520
a pin

1884
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,020
heat map

1885
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,860
and so

1886
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,260
over here

1887
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:40,620
where it's

1888
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,260
really hot

1889
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,440
dates

1890
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,640
dates are

1891
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:45,980
different

1892
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,580
from other

1893
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:46,900
pins

1894
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,700
this is

1895
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,280
you know

1896
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:49,820
day

1897
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,080
day

1898
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:50,340
month

1899
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,640
month

1900
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:50,920
type

1901
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,240
dates

1902
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:51,560
right

1903
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,600
and then

1904
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,880
related couplets

1905
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,560
meaning repeated

1906
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,420
things like

1907
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,060
0101

1908
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,620
0505

1909
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,100
667

1910
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,680
they're all

1911
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,260
along this

1912
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,700
diagonal thing

1913
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,280
okay

1914
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,220
and these are

1915
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:06,980
years of

1916
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,740
specific years

1917
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,760
of 19 something

1918
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,320
because probably

1919
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,000
birth years

1920
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,600
people

1921
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:13,620
for people

1922
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,080
to take

1923
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,460
passwords

1924
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:15,720
back

1925
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,220
so

1926
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,260
as I said

1927
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:20,700
before

1928
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,460
the

1929
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,160
Unix

1930
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,800
and all

1931
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,140
the other

1932
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:24,500
Unix

1933
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,980
like systems

1934
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,760
have this

1935
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,600
etsy

1936
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,540
password file

1937
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:28,900
and it's

1938
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,480
world readable

1939
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,320
for reasons

1940
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:30,620
I already

1941
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,060
explained

1942
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,560
so

1943
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,460
if you don't

1944
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:35,960
do anything

1945
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,300
and just

1946
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:36,960
store the

1947
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,620
hashed

1948
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,080
passwords

1949
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:39,520
in that

1950
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:39,920
file

1951
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,120
the attacker

1952
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,560
will

1953
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,340
easily

1954
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,000
before

1955
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,560
even knowing

1956
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:45,960
what that

1957
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,480
file is

1958
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,120
before breaking

1959
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,800
in or getting

1960
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,220
an accident

1961
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:48,960
the attacker

1962
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,800
can precompute

1963
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,160
a large table

1964
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:51,800
of all the

1965
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,060
hashed

1966
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,400
passwords

1967
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,800
yeah

1968
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,900
I mean

1969
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,620
passwords are

1970
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,220
passwords right

1971
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:58,700
you can just

1972
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,200
pick all the

1973
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,180
dictionary words

1974
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,060
all the dictionary

1975
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,440
words are

1976
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:01,800
reversed

1977
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,500
all the

1978
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:02,920
two word

1979
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,500
combination

1980
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,200
let's restrict

1981
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:05,840
our discussion

1982
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,340
to English

1983
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:06,780
for now

1984
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,160
okay

1985
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,800
because

1986
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,720
similar things

1987
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,200
apply to

1988
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,620
other languages

1989
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,280
but let's say

1990
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,760
yeah

1991
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,760
all the date

1992
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,700
in a standard

1993
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,680
US format

1994
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,620
all the

1995
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,540
even times

1996
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,060
of day

1997
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:18,760
using

1998
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,460
you know

1999
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,040
after a second

2000
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,440
let's say

2001
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,040
granularity

2002
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,740
you can precompute

2003
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,480
hashes of all

2004
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,120
these values

2005
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,000
combinations

2006
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,620
of all these

2007
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,060
values

2008
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,160
pet names

2009
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,700
city names

2010
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,520
state names

2011
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,120
university

2012
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,400
mascot names

2013
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,560
right

2014
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,920
all of these

2015
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,820
can be precomputed

2016
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,260
in a large

2017
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:36,500
database

2018
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,300
stored in a large

2019
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:37,560
database

2020
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,720
that is something

2021
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,420
a task that

2022
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:39,880
an adversary

2023
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,520
could do

2024
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,480
and would take

2025
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,240
maybe a day

2026
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,580
or two

2027
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,360
maybe less

2028
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,500
this can be

2029
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:44,880
stored

2030
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,420
and it can be

2031
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:45,920
done at your

2032
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,360
own leisure

2033
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,320
now

2034
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,000
at the time

2035
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,640
of intrusion

2036
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,220
when the

2037
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,020
adversary gains

2038
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,620
access to

2039
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,760
the password

2040
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,220
file

2041
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:52,720
all the

2042
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,080
adversary

2043
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,600
needs to

2044
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:53,860
do

2045
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,020
is extract

2046
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,460
the hashed

2047
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:55,900
passports

2048
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,360
and do it

2049
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:56,640
database

2050
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,040
basically

2051
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,660
am I with you

2052
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,040
very simple

2053
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,740
so a little bit

2054
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,300
of work ahead

2055
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:03,640
of it

2056
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,260
and then

2057
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:05,900
no work

2058
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,400
essentially

2059
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,320
once the

2060
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,460
password file

2061
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,160
becomes available

2062
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,620
not only that

2063
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:10,900
but the

2064
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,380
adversary can

2065
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:11,780
break into

2066
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,740
multiple systems

2067
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,120
and reuse

2068
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,700
that same

2069
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,520
work that

2070
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,180
we did

2071
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:16,700
earlier

2072
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,640
right

2073
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,120
it's not like

2074
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,520
he has to

2075
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,280
brute force

2076
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,980
anything again

2077
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,180
just a bunch

2078
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:21,680
of database

2079
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,120
who comes

2080
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,460
so that's

2081
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:24,980
nice

2082
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,500
for the

2083
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:25,880
adversary

2084
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,600
bad for

2085
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:26,900
us

2086
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,020
right

2087
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,800
this is

2088
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,200
called an

2089
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,680
offline

2090
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,120
attack

2091
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,740
because the

2092
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,380
adversary has

2093
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:34,800
done the

2094
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,180
bulk of

2095
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:35,580
the work

2096
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,240
offline

2097
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,800
and online

2098
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,260
just does

2099
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:38,740
lookouts

2100
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,340
so that's

2101
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:43,880
why salt

2102
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,200
unlike what

2103
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,620
the doctors

2104
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,260
say is good

2105
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:46,620
for you

2106
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:50,040
we don't

2107
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,800
store hash

2108
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,460
passwords in

2109
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:51,660
new

2110
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,860
password file

2111
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,720
we store

2112
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,180
salted

2113
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:54,640
passwords

2114
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,160
salted

2115
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,580
means

2116
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,940
at the

2117
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,400
time of

2118
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,020
the initial

2119
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,120
creation of

2120
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:00,460
a user

2121
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:00,920
account

2122
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,760
the system

2123
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,100
or the

2124
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:03,780
administrator

2125
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,900
will pick

2126
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,360
a random

2127
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:05,800
number

2128
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,140
called a

2129
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:07,380
salt

2130
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,240
that random

2131
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:09,760
number is

2132
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,220
only used

2133
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:10,880
there in

2134
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,240
the password

2135
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,680
file

2136
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,380
it isn't

2137
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:13,880
stored in

2138
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,180
the plain

2139
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:14,480
text

2140
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,700
but it's

2141
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,960
not reused

2142
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,100
so different

2143
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:19,840
systems will

2144
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,280
have different

2145
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:20,900
salts for the

2146
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,480
same user

2147
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,980
so you

2148
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,540
have a record

2149
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,100
something that

2150
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:26,620
looks something

2151
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,180
like this

2152
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,760
this is maybe

2153
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,620
a little outdated

2154
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,840
that green box

2155
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,200
you see

2156
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,560
gts would be my

2157
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,280
account name

2158
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,560
the salt will be

2159
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,280
that number

2160
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,220
right

2161
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,560
the first blue

2162
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:38,920
number

2163
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,400
the second is

2164
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,020
the hash

2165
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,320
then you have

2166
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:42,980
like user

2167
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,540
identity

2168
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,080
uid

2169
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:44,880
i think that

2170
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,020
the 14510 is

2171
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,460
uid

2172
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,500
30 i don't

2173
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:47,640
remember

2174
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,620
group id or

2175
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:48,940
something

2176
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,940
then the full

2177
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,440
name

2178
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,840
like what my

2179
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,540
actual name is

2180
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,180
and then the

2181
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:53,860
login shell

2182
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,620
right

2183
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,800
and today is

2184
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,320
probably like a

2185
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,720
lot more

2186
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,460
at least that

2187
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,960
but we're not

2188
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,520
interested in

2189
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,380
the rest of the

2190
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:01,680
stuff

2191
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,300
the important

2192
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:02,840
thing is

2193
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,600
the salt

2194
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:03,920
and the

2195
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,340
password

2196
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:04,840
that has

2197
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,300
together

2198
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,600
okay

2199
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,180
so what

2200
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:08,520
happens

2201
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,400
very simple

2202
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,880
little mandate

2203
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,240
right

2204
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:11,860
but makes a

2205
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,420
big difference

2206
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,440
that offline

2207
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,560
attack

2208
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,300
is no longer

2209
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:17,800
possible

2210
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,060
why not

2211
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:26,460
well let me

2212
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:26,820
give you an

2213
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,080
example

2214
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,680
suppose the

2215
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,140
salt was

2216
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,440
one decimal

2217
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:29,800
digit

2218
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,560
would the

2219
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:33,900
offline

2220
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,240
attack

2221
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:34,400
be

2222
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:34,760
possible

2223
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,560
one

2224
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,900
just one

2225
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,200
decimal

2226
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:40,440
digit

2227
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:40,700
meaning

2228
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,100
it's a

2229
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,320
number

2230
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:41,820
from zero

2231
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:42,400
to ten

2232
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,540
would it

2233
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:44,880
be possible

2234
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,300
to mount

2235
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,140
this offline

2236
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:46,500
attack

2237
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,960
of course

2238
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,520
it's possible

2239
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,360
why not

2240
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:50,700
right

2241
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,880
just the work

2242
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,000
increases tenfold

2243
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,900
right

2244
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,500
but okay

2245
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,060
now it depends

2246
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,640
on how long

2247
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,440
exactly you make

2248
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:58,560
it

2249
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,060
but suppose

2250
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,660
you make it

2251
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,700
128 bits

2252
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,700
oh

2253
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,600
now

2254
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,800
one digit

2255
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,900
128 bits

2256
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,620
instead of

2257
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:07,980
like what

2258
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,760
one digit

2259
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,180
is like

2260
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,720
three digits

2261
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,660
right

2262
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,040
so from three

2263
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,820
bits to 128

2264
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,120
bits

2265
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:13,540
now the

2266
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:13,840
adversary

2267
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,600
cannot do

2268
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,840
cannot do

2269
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,100
an offline

2270
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:17,500
attack

2271
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,940
because remember

2272
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,720
for every

2273
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,300
guess of the

2274
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,700
password

2275
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,220
that the

2276
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:22,580
adversary

2277
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:22,980
makes

2278
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,260
he has to

2279
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:25,920
multiply

2280
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,660
do it

2281
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,600
two to the

2282
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,560
128 times

2283
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,400
per password

2284
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
so it

2285
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,760
will be

2286
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,300
two to the

2287
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,300
128 times

2288
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:36,580
whatever

2289
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,260
even two to

2290
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:37,760
the 20

2291
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,100
right

2292
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:38,840
is

2293
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,900
beyond reach

2294
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,180
of the

2295
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:41,540
adversary

2296
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,160
today and

2297
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:42,400
for

2298
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:42,960
what it

2299
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,380
would be

2300
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,100
so originally

2301
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,740
they made the

2302
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:46,980
salt

2303
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:47,640
32 bits

2304
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,160
I'm not sure

2305
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,720
exactly what

2306
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:48,980
it is

2307
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,340
because it

2308
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:49,580
varies

2309
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,040
I think the

2310
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,440
length of the

2311
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:50,940
salt varies

2312
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,480
from unique

2313
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,060
flavor

2314
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:52,480
to unique

2315
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,820
flavor

2316
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,140
but if I

2317
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:54,520
were using

2318
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:54,880
it today

2319
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,180
I would

2320
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:55,500
want the

2321
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:55,820
salt to

2322
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,100
be at

2323
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:56,360
least

2324
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,420
80 but

2325
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,180
probably

2326
00:52:59,180 --> 00:52:59,800
more like

2327
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,260
128

2328
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:00,840
than salt

2329
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,100
is

2330
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,660
healthier

2331
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,100
okay

2332
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:05,800
but salt

2333
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,420
makes a big

2334
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:06,800
difference

2335
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,840
now once the

2336
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,660
attacker breaks

2337
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,020
in

2338
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,200
okay

2339
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,360
now there's a

2340
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:12,980
crucial difference

2341
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,660
between offline

2342
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,240
and online

2343
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:14,560
attack

2344
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,320
once the

2345
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:16,640
attacker

2346
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,140
breaks in

2347
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,400
and reads

2348
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:18,640
the

2349
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,360
lc password

2350
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:19,740
file

2351
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,120
okay

2352
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,660
the attacker

2353
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,120
sees the

2354
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:22,320
salt

2355
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,360
so then the

2356
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:24,940
attack becomes

2357
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,480
much cheaper

2358
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,060
but it can

2359
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,440
only be

2360
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:27,820
mounted

2361
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,200
once he

2362
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,160
breaks in

2363
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,200
not ahead

2364
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,660
because

2365
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:36,580
by knowing

2366
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,100
the salt

2367
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,180
you shave

2368
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:38,600
off the

2369
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:38,940
2 to the

2370
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,280
128

2371
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,400
okay

2372
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,840
and that

2373
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,280
basically

2374
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,880
the explanation

2375
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,280
is the same

2376
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:48,480
thing

2377
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,860
just take a

2378
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,060
second

2379
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,580
to read it

2380
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,940
well you shave

2381
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,260
off the

2382
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:56,580
2 to the

2383
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,140
number 28

2384
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,660
but it's

2385
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,260
no longer

2386
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,400
only off

2387
00:53:59,400 --> 00:53:59,920
line

2388
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,740
fully attack

2389
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,820
no no

2390
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,400
it's online

2391
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,100
it's online

2392
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:03,720
it's not

2393
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,960
offline

2394
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,360
at all

2395
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,460
the attacker

2396
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,080
breaks in

2397
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,760
learns the

2398
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:07,940
salt

2399
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,300
and now

2400
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:08,880
has to do

2401
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,440
with that

2402
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:09,780
salt

2403
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,120
whatever

2404
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,640
2 to the

2405
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:11,980
20

2406
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,500
2 to the

2407
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:12,820
40

2408
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,680
however many

2409
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,080
password

2410
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:14,420
guesses

2411
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,400
there are

2412
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,560
per user

2413
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:16,920
yeah

2414
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,860
so there's

2415
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,240
still a bit

2416
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,580
of work

2417
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:19,900
but it's

2418
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,320
not a scary

2419
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:20,880
amount of work

2420
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,080
I'm sorry

2421
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,020
I mean

2422
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:27,460
we can

2423
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,100
let the salt

2424
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:28,960
expire

2425
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,340
well

2426
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:30,820
you can

2427
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,560
let the salt

2428
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,380
expire

2429
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,060
but you

2430
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,420
have to

2431
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,080
replace it

2432
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,420
in the

2433
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:34,840
password

2434
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,260
file

2435
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:35,940
so

2436
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,900
what you're

2437
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,200
saying

2438
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,600
is that

2439
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:37,960
you know

2440
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,220
if you

2441
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:38,520
know

2442
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:38,740
that

2443
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:38,900
they

2444
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,140
have

2445
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:39,280
the

2446
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:39,360
so

2447
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:39,460
it

2448
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:39,740
takes

2449
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,100
at least

2450
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,540
24

2451
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,000
hours

2452
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,840
to

2453
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,320
mount

2454
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,520
an

2455
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,120
online

2456
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:44,520
attack

2457
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:44,860
once

2458
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:45,020
he

2459
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:45,240
learns

2460
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:45,480
the

2461
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:45,740
salt

2462
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,080
then

2463
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:47,200
you

2464
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:47,320
could

2465
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,580
change

2466
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:47,760
the

2467
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:47,980
salt

2468
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,240
every

2469
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:48,660
24

2470
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:48,900
hour

2471
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,560
you could

2472
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,760
but the

2473
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,440
problem is

2474
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,940
okay

2475
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,380
so this is a good question

2476
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,480
let's think about this

2477
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,640
that what you say

2478
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,980
would be useful

2479
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,640
or would be

2480
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,340
possible

2481
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,140
if

2482
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,560
just

2483
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,760
a password

2484
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,180
attack

2485
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:09,780
a brute force

2486
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,160
password

2487
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,580
attack

2488
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,040
would take

2489
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,420
24

2490
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:11,760
hours

2491
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,420
but remember

2492
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,240
once the adversary

2493
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:14,840
breaks in

2494
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,360
and learns

2495
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:15,900
the salt

2496
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,160
he then

2497
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,960
also knows

2498
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,060
the hash of the salt

2499
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:21,660
and the password

2500
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,020
right

2501
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,780
so the adversary

2502
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,580
knows this

2503
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,840
right

2504
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,100
that

2505
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,020
the

2506
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,260
well

2507
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:27,680
that

2508
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:34,000
the adversary

2509
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,860
knows this

2510
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,860
right

2511
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,400
once he breaks in

2512
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,000
he knows this

2513
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,360
and he also knows

2514
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:39,820
the salt

2515
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,080
so you can change

2516
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,620
the salt

2517
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,060
but he learned

2518
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,180
the previous salt

2519
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:47,820
and the hash

2520
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,740
of the previous salt

2521
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,400
plus password

2522
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,420
he's gonna break

2523
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:51,920
the password

2524
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,760
see

2525
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,580
he's gonna break

2526
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:55,940
the password

2527
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,720
so changing the salt

2528
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,380
at that point

2529
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,720
not effective

2530
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,480
not effective

2531
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,880
because

2532
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,100
if he's breaking

2533
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:04,660
it locally

2534
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,020
maybe

2535
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,320
but

2536
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:05,780
you know

2537
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,100
others

2538
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,440
he's gonna

2539
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,020
exfiltrate

2540
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,520
and break

2541
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,020
it on his own

2542
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,340
path

2543
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,100
so

2544
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:09,820
the password

2545
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,460
hasn't changed

2546
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,040
that's the main

2547
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:11,440
problem

2548
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,240
but here

2549
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:15,700
it says

2550
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,520
12

2551
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,200
I think

2552
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,060
I may be wrong

2553
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,360
it wasn't

2554
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:19,580
30

2555
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,240
I think

2556
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:20,660
it was even

2557
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:21,280
less

2558
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:21,760
it was 12

2559
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,080
bits

2560
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:22,620
originally

2561
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,580
well today

2562
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,000
12 bits

2563
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,520
is laughable

2564
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:24,740
right

2565
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,160
so what

2566
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,440
is it

2567
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:25,720
saying

2568
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,400
if the

2569
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:26,720
passwords

2570
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,200
come from

2571
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:27,420
I don't

2572
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:27,560
know

2573
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,060
2 to the

2574
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:28,340
20

2575
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:28,800
space

2576
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,660
and multiplied

2577
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,300
by 2 to the

2578
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:30,560
12

2579
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:30,920
you still

2580
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,380
get 2 to

2581
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:31,720
32

2582
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,640
which is

2583
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,100
a laughably

2584
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:33,760
small number

2585
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,780
or password

2586
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,140
bracket

2587
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,840
right

2588
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,340
it takes

2589
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,760
a minute

2590
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,180
or less

2591
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,620
to go for

2592
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,080
the 2 to the

2593
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,460
32

2594
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,380
password

2595
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:42,680
choice

2596
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,860
right

2597
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,140
so

2598
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,080
instead

2599
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:47,700
so

2600
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,640
what happens

2601
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,680
these days

2602
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,020
is that

2603
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:50,600
most systems

2604
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,020
actually

2605
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,260
kind of

2606
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:52,680
separate

2607
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,000
the two

2608
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,220
things

2609
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:53,640
they separate

2610
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,380
the password

2611
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,960
from

2612
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,520
the account

2613
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,080
information

2614
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,620
in Unix

2615
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,040
and that's

2616
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,240
kind of

2617
00:56:59,240 --> 00:56:59,460
a good

2618
00:56:59,460 --> 00:56:59,840
practice

2619
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,280
anyway

2620
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,880
so

2621
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,000
they create

2622
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,320
what's called

2623
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:03,700
shadow

2624
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,180
password

2625
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,000
and so

2626
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,800
instead of

2627
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,280
looking like

2628
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:06,800
what you saw

2629
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,320
before

2630
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,380
the account

2631
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,100
record

2632
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:09,540
in the

2633
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:09,800
etsy

2634
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,260
password

2635
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:10,720
file

2636
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,620
has

2637
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,820
the name

2638
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,760
and then

2639
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,220
all the other

2640
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:15,780
information

2641
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,180
but there's

2642
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:16,520
like an

2643
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:16,920
x

2644
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,180
following the

2645
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:18,700
accounting

2646
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,200
that says

2647
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,000
actual password

2648
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,540
isn't here

2649
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,660
it's a

2650
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,120
special

2651
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,260
hashed

2652
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:24,920
password file

2653
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,520
which is not

2654
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,180
world readable

2655
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,280
like it took

2656
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,400
only 30 years

2657
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,140
for people to realize

2658
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,340
that the passwords

2659
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,300
and user account

2660
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:32,780
information

2661
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,500
shouldn't be stored

2662
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,940
together

2663
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,760
well that's what

2664
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,100
happens

2665
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:37,340
right

2666
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,880
because all

2667
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,280
those other

2668
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:39,700
programs

2669
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,700
application programs

2670
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,180
running on

2671
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:41,800
this Unix

2672
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,400
like operating

2673
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:42,740
system

2674
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,680
they still

2675
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,120
do need

2676
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,580
the account

2677
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,120
information

2678
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,040
to figure out

2679
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,600
who can access

2680
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:46,980
what

2681
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:47,280
etc

2682
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,280
and distinguish

2683
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,920
between users

2684
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,300
but

2685
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,160
they don't

2686
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:51,480
need to know

2687
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:51,940
the passwords

2688
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,300
right

2689
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:53,660
so

2690
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,900
let's create

2691
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,620
a file

2692
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,160
that has

2693
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:57,800
all the account

2694
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,240
information

2695
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:58,880
that also

2696
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,480
store passwords

2697
00:57:59,480 --> 00:57:59,700
in

2698
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,160
passwords

2699
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:00,600
should only

2700
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,000
be visible

2701
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,580
to the root

2702
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,220
or the admin

2703
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:02,600
account

2704
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,540
right

2705
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,020
so instead

2706
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,500
it's stored

2707
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,080
in an etsy

2708
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,900
shadow file

2709
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,840
which is only

2710
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,160
readable

2711
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:07,620
by the

2712
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,940
system

2713
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,420
administrator

2714
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,640
okay

2715
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,740
also

2716
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,480
very trivial

2717
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:13,860
thing

2718
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,040
and of course

2719
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:15,360
it also

2720
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,180
added expiration

2721
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:16,420
date

2722
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:16,940
for passwords

2723
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:17,220
right

2724
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,580
so that's

2725
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,500
why on

2726
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,620
most

2727
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:20,400
production

2728
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,200
Unix

2729
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,780
like systems

2730
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,200
you'll be

2731
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:22,540
asked to

2732
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:22,860
renew

2733
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,960
or

2734
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,960
change

2735
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,200
another

2736
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:26,540
password

2737
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,000
every so

2738
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:27,200
often

2739
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,300
okay

2740
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:30,760
so

2741
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,420
you've probably

2742
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:31,820
heard of

2743
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:32,320
keyloggers

2744
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:32,580
right

2745
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,700
so these

2746
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,120
are things

2747
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:36,600
you generally

2748
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,060
have to be

2749
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:37,740
afraid of

2750
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,980
not so much

2751
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:40,480
on your own

2752
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:40,980
devices

2753
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,580
because

2754
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,300
it's not

2755
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:42,780
all that

2756
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,100
easy

2757
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:43,680
to install

2758
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,220
a keylogger

2759
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:44,480
unless

2760
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:44,820
somebody

2761
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,000
has

2762
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,760
direct

2763
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,380
access

2764
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:46,760
and an

2765
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,100
account

2766
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:47,420
on your

2767
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:47,820
device

2768
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,360
but

2769
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:48,880
more like

2770
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,180
when you're

2771
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:49,400
using

2772
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:49,880
public

2773
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,500
facility

2774
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:51,980
like

2775
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:52,460
any of

2776
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:52,700
you ever

2777
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:52,960
use

2778
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,500
ICS

2779
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,060
terminals

2780
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,500
or ICS

2781
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:55,860
machines

2782
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:56,420
but that's

2783
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:56,680
where you

2784
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:56,920
have to

2785
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,280
be worried

2786
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:57,720
about

2787
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,280
because

2788
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,420
there you

2789
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:01,720
have no

2790
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,020
idea

2791
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,380
what software

2792
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:03,880
is running

2793
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,420
who has

2794
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:04,780
been there

2795
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:05,080
before

2796
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,260
you

2797
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:05,560
essentially

2798
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,180
these

2799
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:06,540
machines

2800
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:06,740
are

2801
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,500
sort of

2802
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:08,620
like

2803
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:08,960
public

2804
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,280
toilet

2805
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:09,860
you have

2806
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,380
no idea

2807
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:10,900
what's

2808
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,300
going on

2809
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:11,540
there

2810
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,460
and

2811
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:12,660
what

2812
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:12,800
is

2813
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,040
running

2814
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,260
there

2815
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:13,500
really

2816
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,880
so

2817
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,020
if

2818
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:16,180
these

2819
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:16,660
drugloggers

2820
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:16,900
are

2821
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,440
problem

2822
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,580
they

2823
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,080
can be

2824
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:19,520
hardware

2825
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:19,880
based

2826
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,020
or

2827
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:20,580
software

2828
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:21,020
based

2829
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,860
hardware

2830
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,160
based

2831
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,380
means

2832
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:22,640
somebody

2833
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,080
actually

2834
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,200
inserted

2835
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,860
something

2836
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,240
you

2837
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:27,400
know

2838
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:27,960
external

2839
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,400
keyboards

2840
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:28,760
not the

2841
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,920
kind

2842
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,200
you have

2843
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:29,560
right now

2844
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:29,840
in front

2845
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,000
of you

2846
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,160
but

2847
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:30,560
actual

2848
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,100
keyboards

2849
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,860
move on

2850
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,580
they have

2851
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:32,920
a wire

2852
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,180
some of them

2853
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:35,340
do

2854
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:35,700
some of them

2855
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:35,920
don't

2856
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,300
but most

2857
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:36,800
have a wire

2858
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,520
well

2859
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,460
the wire

2860
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,000
goes in the

2861
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,400
back of the

2862
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:40,680
computer

2863
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,040
somewhere

2864
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,380
or

2865
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,920
some

2866
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,900
USB

2867
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,940
interface

2868
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:44,860
well

2869
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,300
somebody

2870
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:45,560
could have

2871
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,360
installed

2872
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:46,700
something

2873
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:46,980
between

2874
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,460
the USB

2875
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,000
interface

2876
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,240
and the

2877
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:48,420
back

2878
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:48,620
of the

2879
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:48,840
computer

2880
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,280
you cannot

2881
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:49,560
see

2882
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,020
especially

2883
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:50,420
publicly

2884
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,380
and

2885
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,380
essentially

2886
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,440
it

2887
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:54,900
sees

2888
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,200
every

2889
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:55,600
keystroke

2890
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:55,920
you have

2891
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,260
okay

2892
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,460
some

2893
00:59:59,460 --> 00:59:59,820
government

2894
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:00,320
computers

2895
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,520
in various

2896
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:01,940
agencies

2897
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,500
do this

2898
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,060
on purpose

2899
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:03,620
they tell

2900
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,060
employees

2901
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:04,660
your

2902
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,020
keystrokes

2903
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:06,440
are locked

2904
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:06,700
and there's

2905
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,260
a keylogger

2906
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,100
for

2907
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,820
auditability

2908
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,260
and logging

2909
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:09,660
purposes

2910
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,500
but

2911
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,400
do you

2912
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,060
yourself

2913
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:13,620
whenever

2914
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,160
you use

2915
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:14,700
a public

2916
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,440
or at least

2917
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:15,980
not personal

2918
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,400
but do you

2919
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:16,840
have a look

2920
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,940
to see

2921
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,400
that the

2922
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:18,740
wire

2923
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,540
goes directly

2924
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:19,860
into the

2925
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:20,440
USB port

2926
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:20,640
in the

2927
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:20,860
back

2928
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,060
of the

2929
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:21,360
computer

2930
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,200
or

2931
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:22,460
there's

2932
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:22,660
some

2933
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:22,900
other

2934
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:23,460
little

2935
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:23,800
creepy

2936
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,280
crawling

2937
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:24,640
that

2938
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:24,900
is in

2939
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:25,260
between

2940
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,740
I bet

2941
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,120
most people

2942
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:27,540
don't

2943
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,320
with

2944
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:29,960
wireless

2945
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,580
oh

2946
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,100
with wireless

2947
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:32,820
it's even worse

2948
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,200
because the

2949
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:34,560
wireless

2950
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,040
keyboard

2951
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,640
typically

2952
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,000
use

2953
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,500
encryption

2954
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,900
but the

2955
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,180
kind of

2956
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:38,480
encryption

2957
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:38,800
you use

2958
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,140
is often

2959
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:39,820
homegrown

2960
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,180
by the

2961
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:40,660
manufacturer

2962
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,060
or really

2963
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:41,400
crappy

2964
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,540
and so

2965
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,500
you don't

2966
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:44,840
need to

2967
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,440
put a

2968
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:45,760
hardware

2969
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,280
device

2970
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,580
you can

2971
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,160
just sniff

2972
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:48,680
on it

2973
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,680
externally

2974
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,060
right

2975
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:51,340
because

2976
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:51,700
they use

2977
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:51,880
some

2978
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,160
kind of

2979
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,320
either

2980
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:53,820
infrared

2981
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,140
or some

2982
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:54,320
other

2983
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:54,460
kind

2984
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:54,620
of

2985
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,100
wireless

2986
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:59,420
so

2987
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,000
beware

2988
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
but

2989
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,760
attacks

2990
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,660
keylogger

2991
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,020
attacks

2992
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,420
especially

2993
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:04,920
hardware ones

2994
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,160
are not

2995
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:05,380
common

2996
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:05,660
they are

2997
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,100
targeted

2998
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:06,420
right

2999
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:06,740
somebody

3000
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,000
has to

3001
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,260
target

3002
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:07,780
a specific

3003
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:08,140
computer

3004
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:08,560
a specific

3005
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:08,980
person

3006
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:09,640
in order

3007
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:09,920
to do

3008
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,100
that

3009
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:10,820
software

3010
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,340
keyloggers

3011
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:11,780
are different

3012
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,040
that often

3013
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,420
happens

3014
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,620
with buggy

3015
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,200
browsers

3016
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,540
or buggy

3017
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,000
it used

3018
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,340
to happen

3019
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:19,840
once in

3020
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,120
a while

3021
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,720
with microsoft

3022
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,240
windows

3023
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,320
where there

3024
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:22,580
would be

3025
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:23,140
some malware

3026
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:23,560
that would

3027
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,320
warm itself

3028
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:24,980
and usually

3029
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,340
again

3030
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:25,700
with some

3031
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,080
degree of

3032
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,840
social engineering

3033
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,620
preceding it

3034
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,660
and then

3035
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:29,380
will

3036
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:29,700
install

3037
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:29,940
itself

3038
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:30,320
and actually

3039
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,100
take over

3040
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,140
the keyboard

3041
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,360
driver

3042
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,220
or worse

3043
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:35,400
yet

3044
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:35,860
update

3045
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,420
the keyboard

3046
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:36,820
driver

3047
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:37,080
right

3048
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:37,300
because

3049
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:37,740
the keyboard

3050
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:38,080
is a

3051
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:38,400
peripheral

3052
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,140
right

3053
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:39,800
there's a

3054
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,100
driver

3055
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:40,500
for that

3056
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:40,900
peripheral

3057
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,460
to

3058
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,360
insert an

3059
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,000
illegitimate

3060
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,820
fake update

3061
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:44,180
of the

3062
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:44,540
driver

3063
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,000
that would

3064
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,340
contain

3065
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,000
a keylogger

3066
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,300
not nice

3067
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,320
and then

3068
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:49,700
there are

3069
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,120
like

3070
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:50,800
lower tech

3071
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,480
ways of

3072
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,000
sniffing

3073
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,400
on

3074
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,760
keyboard

3075
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,260
input

3076
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,320
shoulder

3077
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:55,760
surfing

3078
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,480
everybody

3079
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:57,880
familiar

3080
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,100
with

3081
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:58,320
shoulder

3082
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:58,640
surfing

3083
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,260
yeah

3084
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:00,700
people are

3085
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:00,880
getting

3086
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,380
too close

3087
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,180
to you

3088
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,100
too close

3089
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:03,600
for comfort

3090
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,960
you're entering

3091
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,520
your pen

3092
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,220
whether it's

3093
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:06,500
on the

3094
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:06,900
door

3095
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:07,500
block

3096
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:07,900
or

3097
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,660
on your

3098
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:08,940
bank

3099
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:09,420
ATM

3100
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:09,940
somebody's

3101
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:10,080
like

3102
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:10,380
breathing

3103
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:10,680
down

3104
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,120
your neck

3105
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,220
that's

3106
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:12,440
shoulder

3107
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:12,800
surfing

3108
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,520
I mean

3109
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,040
easy to

3110
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:15,440
avoid

3111
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,400
but you have

3112
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:17,580
to be

3113
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:17,820
coming

3114
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:18,100
center

3115
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:18,400
right

3116
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,140
but

3117
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:19,380
shoulder

3118
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:19,680
surfing

3119
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,160
means that

3120
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:20,460
human

3121
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,700
eyes are

3122
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:22,920
looking

3123
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,260
at something

3124
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:23,760
but it's not

3125
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,240
always human

3126
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:24,560
eyes

3127
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,500
it could be

3128
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,340
a tiny little

3129
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:26,740
drone

3130
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,200
it could be

3131
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:28,700
a camera

3132
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,300
from farther

3133
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:30,680
away

3134
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,000
with a

3135
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,500
telephoto

3136
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:31,840
lens

3137
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,460
that is

3138
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,720
shoulder

3139
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,180
surfing

3140
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,420
right

3141
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,280
so

3142
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,080
it could be

3143
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,680
think about

3144
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:38,800
it

3145
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,420
you go

3146
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:39,960
let's

3147
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,080
say

3148
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,420
let's

3149
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:40,580
take

3150
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:40,960
example

3151
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,100
of

3152
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:41,220
the

3154
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,700
anybody

3155
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:42,920
ever

3156
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,080
go

3157
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:43,200
to

3158
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:43,280
the

01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:43,540
ATM

3160
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:43,860
anymore

3161
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,980
I think

3162
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:46,200
I go

3163
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:46,460
once

3164
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:46,680
twice

3165
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:46,960
a year

3166
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,560
but

3167
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:48,940
still

3168
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,200
people

3169
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:49,420
do

3170
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:49,840
I can

3171
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,120
see you

3172
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:50,400
every time

3173
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:50,540
I go

3174
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:50,740
to the

3175
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:50,900

01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,080
recently

3385
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,320
maybe

3386
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:37,520
not

3387
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:37,880
exactly

3388
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,080
the

3389
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:38,400
sequence

3390
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:38,920
but

3391
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,220
how many

3392
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:39,600
combinations

3393
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:39,880
that

3394
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:39,940
are

3395
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:40,760
right

3396
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,760
so

3397
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,460
something to worry about

3398
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,560
then there is something called acoustic emanation

3399
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,020
there's a whole body of research literature on this

3400
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,240
starting in like 25 years ago

3401
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,480
people realize

3402
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,680
people realize

3403
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,500
that when you type on any surface

3404
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,500
be it a keyboard

3405
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:01,860
or a

3406
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:02,040
thing

3407
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,580
even on the phone

3408
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:05,400
on the

3409
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,620
on screen keyboard

3410
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,820
there are sounds that are being named

3411
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,680
and sound propagates

3412
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,180
right

3413
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,980
when you type

3414
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,200
especially in some of those

3415
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,040
people like me

3416
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:16,300
etc

3417
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:16,940
aggressive

3418
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:17,340
times

3419
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:20,140
sound propagates

3420
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:20,540
farther

3421
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,480
than the human ears

3422
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:22,760
right

3423
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,440
so if you put a very sensitive microphone

3424
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,800
you know

3425
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,840
ten yards away

3426
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,100
people still pick up

3427
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,500
keyboard emanations

3428
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,660
isn't that scary

3429
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:35,180
I think it's very cool

3430
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,900
I have a lot of research on this

3431
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,220
still these days

3432
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,300
there are people who work at it

3433
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:40,500
but

3434
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,100
the sound

3435
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,500
that your

3436
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,140
fingers make

3437
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,380
when you type in

3438
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,100
anything

3439
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,400
not just the classroom

3440
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,100
is unique

3441
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,000
not because

3442
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,460
so much

3443
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:53,420
that you make it

3444
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,060
but the keyboard

3445
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:55,520
itself

3446
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,000
produces a different sound

3447
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,620
for any different key

3448
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,680
every key

3449
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,800
on your plastic keyboard

3450
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,060
makes a different sound

3451
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:07,540
the same

3452
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,740
to a lesser extent

3453
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,020
old story about the keyboard

3454
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:10,420
you have

3455
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,760
but every time you press a key

3456
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,060
the sound that it makes

3457
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:15,800
when you press a Z

3458
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,720
is different from the sound

3459
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,280
that it makes you

3460
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,040
when you press a D

3461
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,060
or slash

3462
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,140
or a question mark

3463
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:20,640
or space

3464
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,160
okay

3465
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,420
there are different sounds

3466
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,600
and so

3467
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,880
if I record those sounds

3468
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,260
I essentially can key log

3469
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,500
without installing a key log

3470
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,020
isn't that fun

3471
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,620
but it gets worse

3472
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,880
much worse

3473
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,680
even if the manufacturers

3474
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,820
and some made an effort

3475
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:41,500
some didn't

3476
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,220
to make all the keyboard

3477
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,240
sounds sound the same

3478
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,200
it's possible

3479
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,640
it makes people

3480
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,380
more expensive

3481
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:51,540
there's still a problem

3482
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,900
does anybody see the problem?

3483
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,020
yourself as a person

3484
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,480
what about yourself?

3485
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:02,060
I mean

3486
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,380
some people

3487
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,280
have just

3488
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,080
and they find

3489
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:06,660
and they just

3490
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:07,700
make themselves

3491
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,280
because of the finger

3492
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:09,640
and

3493
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,080
uh-huh

3494
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:10,960
yeah

3495
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,240
yeah

3496
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:11,940
so remember

3497
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,440
it's true

3498
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,080
that

3499
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:14,980
what I said before

3500
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,020
is that there's you

3501
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,820
who types differently

3502
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,140
depending on which key you type

3503
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,420
and then there's the actual keyboard

3504
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:22,500
that makes different sounds

3505
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,480
so even if you press

3506
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,640
the same way

3507
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,320
on the same

3508
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,120
like

3509
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,320
you have this finger

3510
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,080
like you're one of those

3511
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:29,780
hunter tech

3512
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,160
people like me

3513
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,300
like

3514
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,420
you move the keyboard

3515
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,980
hit

3516
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:36,940
move the keyboard

3517
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:37,320
hit it

3518
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:37,720
so you see

3519
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,980
my angle doesn't change

3520
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,040
so I hit the same way

3521
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,000
right

3522
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,400
but the keyboard sound

3523
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:43,880
is different

3524
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,840
but

3525
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,860
manufacturers suppose

3526
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,820
now fix the keyboard

3527
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:49,620
that all the sounds

3528
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,100
are the same

3529
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,920
but I haven't changed

3530
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,220
right

3531
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,300
so

3532
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,280
when I use my

3533
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,780
this finger

3534
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,840
that goes straight down

3535
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,920
on this one letter

3536
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,900
it sounds one way

3537
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,600
when I have to angle my finger

3538
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,920
to press shift

3539
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,000
right

3540
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,680
or press question mark

3541
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,680
it sounds differently

3542
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,920
not because of the keyboard

3543
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,220
but because of the way

3544
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:10,720
I angle my fingers

3545
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,820
and the force I apply

3546
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:12,720
correct

3547
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,580
but it gets worse than that

3548
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:16,540
that

3549
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:16,880
so

3550
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:17,800
you can indeed

3551
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,940
still mine the information

3552
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:19,380
like I said

3553
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,740
about the individual

3554
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,080
humans typing

3555
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,040
characteristics

3556
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:23,520
but

3557
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,560
it's harder

3558
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,380
it's harder

3559
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,340
it's easier to extract

3560
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,180
from the manufacturer

3561
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:27,780
introduced

3562
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:28,560
distinction

3563
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,360
though

3564
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,100
the problem is

3565
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:30,960
what did you say

3566
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:31,320
time

3567
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,340
like time between keys

3568
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,160
time between keys

3569
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:33,900
that's the problem

3570
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,200
turns out

3571
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,120
on a standard

3572
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,240
QWERTY keyboard

3573
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:37,880
let's assume

3574
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,920
that we're using

3575
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,560
QWERTYs

3576
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:39,800
right

3577
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,540
which is an American

3578
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:41,060
keyboard

3579
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:44,480
as you move

3580
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,680
from key to key

3581
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,740
right

3582
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:49,720
from let's say

3583
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,340
typing key

3584
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,180
to typing H

3585
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:51,940
to typing E

3586
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,800
to typing N

3587
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,500
to typing E

3588
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,280
to typing X

3589
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,060
to typing E

3590
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:57,000
right

3591
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,960
you type one letter

3592
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,420
at a time

3593
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,120
even if you are

3594
01:08:59,120 --> 01:08:59,680
touch typist

3595
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,580
you type one letter

3596
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:01,100
at a time

3597
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:01,700
well

3598
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,080
the intervals

3599
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,060
the timing intervals

3600
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,660
between successive letters

3601
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,340
are unique to you

3602
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,160
also

3603
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,420
and the keyboard

3604
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,180
they sound like

3605
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:10,660
that's right

3606
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:11,740
they're slightly different

3607
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:12,000
yeah

3608
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,460
yeah

3609
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:12,800
but

3610
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,680
that's right

3611
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:14,940
they sound

3612
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:15,560
that's true

3613
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,180
but that's actually

3614
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:16,980
related more

3615
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:17,600
to what he said

3616
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,100
but just

3617
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,420
the sheer timings

3618
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,600
between the keystrokes

3619
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,640
so you don't have

3620
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,620
to have any idea

3621
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:24,980
but

3622
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,380
guess what

3623
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:26,940
there are

3624
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:27,620
let's say

3625
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,600
forget the

3626
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,500
exclamation points

3627
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,000
forget those

3628
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,660
special characters

3629
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:31,280
let's suppose

3630
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:31,620
there are

3631
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,100
I don't know

3632
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,100
26 keys

3633
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,580
on the keyboard

3634
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:34,880
and you're just

3635
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:35,960
typing words

3636
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,260
right

3637
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,520
so how many

3638
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:38,960
possible

3639
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,520
two word

3640
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,060
combinations

3641
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:40,480
are there

3642
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:40,880
two letter

3643
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,220
combinations

3644
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:41,500
are there

3645
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,420
26 times 26

3646
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:42,800
right

3647
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,560
so after a while

3648
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:44,920
if you

3649
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,340
record

3650
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,260
the sounds

3651
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:47,680
of somebody

3652
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,080
typing

3653
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,020
a lot of text

3654
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:49,280
right

3655
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:49,980
over the day

3656
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:50,740
or two days

3657
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:51,140
or whatever

3658
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,100
you're going to

3659
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,040
start distinguishing

3660
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,500
between transitions

3661
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,320
between keys

3662
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:55,720
right

3663
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:59,040
believe me

3664
01:09:59,040 --> 01:09:59,940
it's totally doable

3665
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:01,660
because

3666
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,000
assuming

3667
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:03,460
somebody

3668
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:03,980
is typing

3669
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:04,920
English text

3670
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,240
right

3671
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:05,820
like writing

3672
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,700
email messages

3673
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,900
or filling out

3674
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:08,420
forms

3675
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:09,460
well

3676
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:11,420
the probability

3677
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,120
of occurrence

3678
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,260
of two successive

3679
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,220
letters

3680
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,820
are quite distinct

3681
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,000
and essentially

3682
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,400
becomes

3683
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,460
a simple

3684
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:18,740
decision

3685
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:19,840
so anyway

3686
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:20,460
that was a little

3687
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:20,920
detour

3688
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,700
but what about

3689
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:22,420
good vibrations

3690
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,400
well good vibrations

3691
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,240
refers to another

3692
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:24,680
thing that

3693
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,480
actually

3694
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,680
if you're using

3695
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,220
your phone

3696
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:27,980
and that has

3697
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:28,480
been some

3698
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,260
published research

3699
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:29,620
on this

3700
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,280
and your phone

3701
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:31,840
is like this

3702
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,480
on your

3703
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,060
desk

3704
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,000
or whatever

3705
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,820
in front of you

3706
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:36,040
right

3707
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:36,720
and

3708
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,040
as you press

3709
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:38,600
every

3710
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,840
on-screen

3711
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,560
button

3712
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:40,820
right

3713
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,560
on-screen keyboard

3714
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,780
your phone

3715
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:43,420
makes like a tiny

3716
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:44,200
vibration sound

3717
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,840
like a moment

3718
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,340
that the other

3719
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:46,840
phone do

3720
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,120
right

3721
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,380
just to confirm

3722
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:48,880
that you actually

3723
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,520
type

3724
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,680
well

3725
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,260
those vibrations

3726
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:54,520
when you put a

3727
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:54,880
microphone

3728
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,520
underneath your

3729
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:55,960
desk

3730
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,720
they can actually

3731
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,480
calculate your

3732
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:57,740
typing

3733
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:02,400
other analysis

3734
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,180
include taking

3735
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:03,800
photos of

3736
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,900
smartphone screens

3737
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,340
and looking for

3738
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,820
quadrants

3739
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:08,540
little areas

3740
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,240
on your screen

3741
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,500
that are

3742
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,300
most

3743
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,480
like smudged

3744
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,840
that

3745
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,900
leaks information

3746
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:16,640
about your

3747
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,700
password

3748
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,980
or the

3749
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:19,800
unlock pattern

3750
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,100
you know

3751
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:20,300
this

3752
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:20,700
like

3753
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,580
anybody use

3754
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:22,160
unlock patterns

3755
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,980
like five years

3756
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:24,200
ago

3757
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,600
everybody in this

3758
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:25,880
class

3759
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,220
was like

3760
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:26,580
yes

3761
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:27,740
I guess

3762
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:27,980
they are

3763
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:28,580
faster now

3764
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,840
but apparently

3765
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,440
you know

3766
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,380
if your human

3767
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:32,760
fingers leave

3768
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,400
like oil

3769
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,400
residue

3770
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,180
on the screen

3771
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:36,340
and so

3772
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:36,980
if you take

3773
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:37,600
a high resolution

3774
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,160
photo of

3775
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:38,580
somebody's

3776
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:39,480
smartphone screen

3777
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,660
you've got to

3778
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:41,080
figure out

3779
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:41,440
what the

3780
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,060
unlock pattern

3781
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:42,340
is

3782
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,880
yeah

3783
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,220
so all this

3784
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:46,880
is good stuff

3785
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,420
but the problem

3786
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,020
is of course

3787
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,440
like that

3788
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:49,960
the passwords

3789
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,340
right

3790
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:51,720
why do I

3791
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,260
talk about

3792
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:52,660
all this

3793
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:53,120
previous stuff

3794
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:53,780
because that

3795
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:54,080
would be

3796
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:54,740
not only just

3797
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:55,180
a way of

3798
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:55,800
snoop on

3799
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,140
what you're

3800
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:56,400
doing

3801
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:56,880
but of course

3802
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,380
to snoop on

3803
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:57,820
your passwords

3804
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:58,740
right

3805
01:11:58,740 --> 01:11:59,240
that's the way

3806
01:11:59,240 --> 01:11:59,640
to actually

3807
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,660
and sort of

3808
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:01,080
learn your

3809
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:01,360
password

3810
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,780
the worst

3811
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:03,480
thing we can

3812
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,020
do is write

3813
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:04,480
them down

3814
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,260
because then

3815
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,520
writing them

3816
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:06,800
down

3817
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,780
whether it's

3818
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:08,780
on a device

3819
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:09,300
or a piece

3820
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:09,660
of paper

3821
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:10,300
that becomes

3822
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,980
a way to

3823
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:12,500
like cause

3824
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:12,900
denial of

3825
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:13,200
service

3826
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:13,540
etc

3827
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:14,820
we can

3828
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:15,400
pick passwords

3829
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:15,660
that are

3830
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:15,980
easy to

3831
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:16,460
remember

3832
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:20,480
some places

3833
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:20,920
don't even

3834
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,580
have passwords

3835
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:22,080
I've seen

3836
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:22,640
a few

3837
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,640
systems

3838
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,140
websites

3839
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:24,660
which

3840
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:25,300
completely

3841
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:25,740
have no

3842
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:26,080
passwords

3843
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:26,540
but instead

3844
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,100
have these

3845
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:27,720
special

3846
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,300
questions

3847
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,120
like

3848
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:29,720
they give

3849
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,120
you five

3850
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:30,480
special

3851
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:30,920
questions

3852
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,320
every time

3853
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:31,620
you want to

3854
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:31,900
log in

3855
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:32,220
you have to

3856
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:32,720
answer four

3857
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,080
out of five

3858
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:33,340
friends

3859
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:34,380
but they all

3860
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:34,760
tend to be

3861
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,000
of this

3862
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,380
variety

3863
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:36,040
what's your

3864
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:36,580
favorite pet's

3865
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:36,780
name

3866
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:37,980
rover

3867
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:38,520
bio

3868
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,920
jerry

3869
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,780
and they

3870
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:42,120
give you

3871
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:42,940
some of

3872
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:43,200
them are

3873
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:43,460
worse

3874
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:43,900
than others

3875
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:44,320
some of

3876
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:44,600
them allow

3877
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:44,980
you free

3878
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:45,580
text entry

3879
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,660
which is

3880
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:46,940
better

3881
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:47,300
and some

3882
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:47,580
of them

3883
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,000
give you

3884
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,480
a choice

3885
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,880
like

3886
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,100
out of

3887
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:50,560
these five

3888
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,000
pet names

3889
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,360
which one

3890
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:51,660
is your

3891
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:51,940

3892
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,980

3893
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:53,500
seriously

3894
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,720
terrible

3895
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,200
easily

3896
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:57,700
guessable

3897
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,180
alright

3898
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:58,540
I think

3899
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:58,880
we should

3900
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,100

01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,240
