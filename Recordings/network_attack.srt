1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
which mail, as you'll know, has a mail from field, right, or all the emails that you receive have a from field, and that usually contains user ID, right, where is it coming from, and some domain name, that will result in the DNS lookup as well, and all kinds of spam checks and other ancillary encountered links will cause, even if bounce, like when an email bounces, even that requires that.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
DNS lookup. Also, we'll talk separately about phishing, but many anti-phishing defenses rely on DNS, right, so they try to resolve a particular name and see if it's a legitimate record or if it's something iffy, right, so that's a problem, and that's the, so spoofing phishing with DNS

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:18,000
lookups, with poison DNS lookups, it's called farming, ph there, or phishing, from phishing. Let's see. There is also some nifty ways of what's called doing dynamic farming, which is essentially works like this. You provide

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:47,980
a bogus, like a fake DNS mapping, or a trusted server, and trick a victim, a user, into downloading a malicious script from some attackers controlled evil server. And then the idea is that, what, what, what, what, what, what a phishers or attackers are generally after, they're after obtaining some sensitive information. So, the idea is that you download a malicious script from some evil attacker controlled

5
00:01:47,980 --> 00:02:17,980
server server, and then force the user to also download some restricted internal content. Think about not your home, think about working for a company, right, organization, where you have sensitive content hosted internally, okay? Like some maybe scripted salary lookups, or personnel record management, or some proprietary product designs, okay?

6
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:24,980
So, if you have sensitive information, and so the idea, the attacker's goal is to get access to that sensitive information, right?

7
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:46,980
So, if you manage to do that, right, and if you manage to fool JavaScript into, or the browser to realizing that, oh, the evil, the evil script, right, if you download it, and the sensitive content that that evil script tries to access,

8
00:02:46,980 --> 00:03:06,980
have the same origin, then access will be granted. Java, I mean, your browsers usually have this policy, I mean, all browsers have this policy called same origin policy, which means that, and that's why, for example, cookies tend to be, unless they are third party cookies, tend to be proprietary, right?

9
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:28,980
The cookie from let's say, Microsoft cannot be read by cookie from IBM, right? So they are separate. And that has to do with that same, fundamental same origin policy, right? So if HTML, if a page comes from IBM, and it wants to access a Microsoft cookie, it cannot, because they have different origins.

10
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:50,980
Okay? Because cookie by Microsoft was put there by MSN.com, or MS.com, or Microsoft.com, and cookie from IBM has an origin of IBM.com. Two different origins. But, if you have, let's say, WW, MSN, MS.com, it can access a cookie placed by MS.com, because the origin is the same.

11
00:03:50,980 --> 00:04:12,980
So that's the idea. So that's the idea. So let's consider an example. Okay, I'll give you an example. We have a web server, okay? And it sits at this address, intergood.net, okay, inside the organization, okay? And it has a private IP address.

12
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:28,980
If everybody know this, okay, private IP addresses are different from public IP addresses, so it's like an internal network, a mail, and the address, let's say, is 10-0-0-7, and this server cannot be accessed from outside, okay?

13
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:38,980
So if you try to connect from the outside, the firewall will not match, okay? And anyway, you cannot, there's no routing to that address, right?

14
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:50,980
If you try to send a packet from the outside to 10-0-0-7, you'll get a destination and reach it even without firewall, because that's called a private IP address.

15
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,980
And IP routing or internet routing does not route to such addresses.

16
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:04,980
Okay, so this web server hosts, stores sensitive data and sensitive applications, okay?

17
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:18,980
So what the attacker does is that the attacker sits at evil.org, gets a user who is an inside, Alice, to browse www.evil.org, okay?

18
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:32,980
And you might think, well, how does he do that? But by now you should probably realize that there are many ways to do this with a, let's say, poison SMS message, iMessage, WhatsApp message, signal message, whatever.

19
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,980
You can come on any messaging service, you can also come via email. Messaging is better because it's usually very quick, right?

20
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,980
And if somebody falls for the phishing, they will do it very quickly, right?

21
00:05:44,980 --> 00:06:00,980
So the idea is that to get Alice to browse this, I mean, basically click on a link with www.evil.org, and the attackers placed a malicious JavaScript code on that evil.org, okay?

22
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:13,980
And that code, right, as Alice enters www.evil.org, slash whatever, or slash nothing, and she automatically downloads, right, this JavaScript.

23
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:22,980
Totally fine to download JavaScript. You can turn off JavaScript, but then a lot of websites won't work, right?

24
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:39,980
So, okay, and so now this JavaScript says, okay, now I am inside, I can access something on this interhood.net, which is the internal server, like some CGI app or something like that.

25
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,980
But it can't do that. It can't do that because that would be a violation of, say, origin policy, right?

26
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:55,980
Because the origin of malicious JavaScript is exactly www, is actually evil.org.

27
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:02,980
Evil.org, not equal to good.net, okay?

28
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,980
Different origin, goodbye. So, no way.

29
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:18,980
But, if the attacker also controls DNS, that becomes a real problem.

30
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,980
So, here's the scenario. Go for it step by step.

31
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:29,980
So, we have ZDAT 10.0.0.21, Alice's computer device.

32
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,980
So, Alice has been tricked into looking up some way, right?

33
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,980
www.evil.org.

34
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,980
So, this goes to evil.org DNS.

35
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
There's a DNS server, right?

36
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,980
Authoritative DNS server that's set up by the adversary.

37
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,980
And I'm showing you not all interactions.

38
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,980
Actually, when you look up DNS, remember, you go to the root, right?

39
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:02,980
And the root says, oh, it's going to the .org, and then .org says, oh, okay, here's the evil.org DNS server.

40
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Remember that?

41
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,980
There's a multiple step.

42
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
I'm omitting that.

43
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980
I'm just saying.

44
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,980
I'm basically abstracting it away.

45
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:16,980
So, eventually, good.net, the power goes to this evil.org DNS server, and gets back an address, a real address,

46
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:23,980
an external address, 222334455, with a pretty short TTL, right?

47
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,980
So, it's not going to sit in the cache for too long, right?

48
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,980
And then, right, as she actually does a get, right?

49
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:40,980
Because when you do a click on the URL, the first thing is the DNS looked up, and then you actually do an HTTP get.

50
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,980
So, she gets something.

51
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,980
I put the slash there, but whatever.

52
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
It doesn't really matter.

53
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,980
Some URL from there, okay?

54
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,980
On this evil.org, and the response is a malicious JavaScript, right?

55
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,980
Some kind of a page that contains a malicious JavaScript code.

56
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
Okay?

57
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,980
You're with me so far?

58
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Okay.

59
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,980
That comes from an evil.org website.

60
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
Okay?

61
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Not from the DNS server, from evil DNS server, but the evil.org actual website.

62
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,980
And that's the correct, that 222 address is actually correct for that.

63
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Now, because that TTL expires very quickly, right?

64
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,980
Some here, here, it expires, the TTL.

65
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:28,980
So, the next time, or actually the next time, when as Alice loads the web page, okay?

66
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
There can be some delay, right?

67
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
That can be inserted there.

68
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:40,980
And the JavaScript will again force a lookup of www.evil.org.

69
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,980
Now, that will not be found in the cache because the TTL already expired, right?

70
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,980
So, this record there that says 222, that's gone.

71
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
It expired.

72
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
That's why it's very short.

73
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
It's a short TTL.

74
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,980
And what's going to come back from evil.org DNS, this evil.org DNS, the same one as ever

75
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,980
on top, is now a different address, 1007.

76
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,980
See the trick?

77
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,980
Very, very clever, right?

78
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:22,980
And that 1007 points not to evil.org web, but points to an internal sensitive content server.

79
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,980
That should only be accessed from the inside, by the insiders.

80
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,980
Okay.

81
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,980
Now, again, this is Alice, right?

82
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Alice's device, but it's executing malicious code, right?

83
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:47,980
It says post CGI app, some kind of invoking some sensitive CGI app on the evil.org.

84
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,980
But now evil.org is at 1007.

85
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Okay?

86
00:10:52,980 --> 00:11:00,980
So, the post command, the HTTP post command, goes through the intragut net.

87
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,980
And the response is, that's it.

88
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,980
That's the compromise, right?

89
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
Now, this CGI is critical.

90
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,980
What about database query?

91
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,980
Okay?

92
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,980
Whatever.

93
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,980
It could be an embedded SQL query.

94
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,980
Okay?

95
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,980
It comes back here with the results, and it will be sent outside.

96
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,980
Okay?

97
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,980
I don't show you that.

98
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,980
But the reason this attack works is because now the JavaScript, the same origin policy that

99
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:39,980
it uses, is now satisfying, because the original, sorry, because the evil.org provided this address,

100
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:45,980
and intergoodnet is associated with this address now.

101
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:55,980
And therefore, the malicious JavaScript can access 1007 because they have the same origin.

102
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
Okay?

103
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,980
The origin is now evil.org, the same origin.

104
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,980
So, the attack succeeds.

105
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,980
Now, how do you solve this problem?

106
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,980
If you know of the attack, and you wanted just a knee-jerk solution, you can say, well,

107
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,980
the problem is due to the short TTL.

108
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,980
Does that really help?

109
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,980
I mean, it solves that attack problem, right?

110
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,980
But what if the attacker just does it over and over?

111
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,980
The same thing just until the attacker might know where the TTL is, right?

112
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:49,980
Because the attacker can always, so the idea is that not accepting short TTLs, right?

113
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:59,980
And sort of overriding them with long TTLs, long times, so that this entry with 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 does not expire.

114
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,980
But eventually, it will, right?

115
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,980
So, it's just sort of hedging the attack a little bit.

116
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,980
It's not really solving the problem.

117
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:18,980
One possibility is to randomize the client port.

118
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,980
This is a general solution, right?

119
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,980
So, you know, when the DNS servers, the DNS lives in a very specific reserved port.

120
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,980
But remember, the clients pick a random port number.

121
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Well, they're supposed to.

122
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,980
So, if you randomize the port number, instead of using always sort of the same,

123
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,980
then that might help the attack, because the attacker has to guess that and transaction ID to reply.

124
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
But this doesn't solve this problem.

125
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,980
This solves other attacks we discussed in the last class.

126
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,980
It doesn't solve this problem.

127
00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:01,980
The other possibility is to introduce some kind of a cryptographic or some more fundamental changes to DNS

128
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
and add something.

129
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Kind of like with IP, there's IPsec.

130
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,980
With HTTP, there is SSLTLS.

131
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:17,980
So, there is something called DNSsec that can help with some of this.

132
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,980
Okay, so what is DNSsec?

133
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,980
Basically, it's extensions to the DNS operation and it works in two ways.

134
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,980
There is the public key version and a secret key version.

135
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,980
Or a symmetric key version, excuse me.

136
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:39,980
And so the goal is to authenticate and check integrity of DNS requests.

137
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,980
Okay, so the idea is that the client issues a query.

138
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,980
Most of the problems occur not on the server side, right?

139
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,980
It's on the client side.

140
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:55,980
So the client receives a query, sorry, receives a query response that is not corresponding to what he asked.

141
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:04,980
So, if you have a secure channel between the client and the DNS server, that should presumably solve the problem.

142
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Yes?

143
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:14,980
Are we assuming the DNS server isn't doing the attack itself?

144
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Right.

145
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,980
Right.

146
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,980
Exactly.

147
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,980
What is this solve?

148
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,980
The DNS server.

149
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,980
Right.

150
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,980
So, remember.

151
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,980
This.

152
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
This attack.

153
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,980
Right.

154
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,980
This.

155
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Right.

156
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,980
The race attack.

157
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,980
The race to, or the attacker to guess the right transaction ID.

158
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Here, the randomizing the port number would help.

159
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
Right.

160
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
It would.

161
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,980
Because if the attacker does not, because we see the attacker is not snooping on all this.

162
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,980
Right.

163
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,980
He's not there.

164
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
He's outside.

165
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,980
So, randomizing the port number will help because the attacker would not snooping on all this.

166
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,980
Right.

167
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,980
He's not there.

168
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,980
He's outside.

169
00:15:47,980 --> 00:16:07,980
So, randomizing the port number will help because the attacker would not only have to guess the transaction ID, but would also have to guess the port number.

170
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:18,980
And if you make it, you know, it's a 32-bit port number, then, sorry, 16-bit port number plus 16-bit transaction ID, that's guessing 32 bits less hard.

171
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,980
Okay.

172
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Much harder.

173
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,980
Much less likely the attacker will win.

174
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:34,980
And the other problem the DNSSEC will solve is if the DNS server actually replies, it will reply with an authentic reply.

175
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,980
Meaning it will actually secure the reply, right, and the attacker can no longer spoof it.

176
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,980
Because eventually, you see, the DNS server does reply.

177
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,980
And only, and if we use DNSSEC, only this reply will be authentic.

178
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,980
So, all the other attempts to answer will be discarded because they're not authentic.

179
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,980
Okay.

180
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,980
So, how does DNSSEC work?

181
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
Well, it's actually very simple, right?

182
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:15,980
It just basically, you know, in a public key version, it just signs the record, right?

183
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,980
So, remember, it replies with the record, right?

184
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:33,980
Now, there is a bit of a debate whether you should sign it on the reply, meaning include the request in the reply, so that you can say this reply is exactly for this request.

185
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,980
Okay?

186
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:45,980
Or, you should pre-compute signed replies ahead of time, and that way save real-time computation.

187
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
You follow me?

188
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,980
Because DNS servers are busy, right?

189
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,980
They're servers for a reason.

190
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,980
They get a lot of queries.

191
00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:11,980
So, if you pre-compute signatures on popular DNS records, like for example, if a UCI has a DNS server and it pre-computes everything for like ICS-UCI-EDU or ENG-UCI-EDU, that would be smart, right?

192
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:19,980
Because there will be a lot of queries for those, but it doesn't need to pre-compute answers to all DNS queries for all hosts, right?

193
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,980
In the inside UCI, because there's just too many of them, and most of them aren't very, very popular in terms of people going to them.

194
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,980
Okay?

195
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,980
So, there is a trade-off there, which can be done in advance.

196
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,980
The trade-off is that if you don't, if you pre-compute the signed, right?

197
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:50,980
If you have public, or digitally signed replies, that means you cannot one-to-one associate the request with a reply, because multiple requests will result in the same reply.

198
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
Okay?

199
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,980
That raises some issues.

200
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,980
Nothing super critical.

201
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
You know?

202
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,980
Now, the other problem is that, how do you distribute public keys?

203
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,980
That's basically the fundamental public key distribution problem, right?

204
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,980
So, the PKDNS assumes that the DNS servers have a public key hierarchy.

205
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
PKI.

206
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,980
Remember we talked about this earlier on?

207
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,980
But that's actually not difficult, because the DNS itself is a hierarchy.

208
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
Right?

209
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:26,980
With all these roots, and then secondlevel.com.edu.org, and then all the others underneath.

210
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,980
So, establishing a hierarchy is actually pretty natural.

211
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:44,980
There is a minor mid-weight version called DNSSEC symmetric key, and basically there it's faster, but it assumes here that there are these pre-established secure channels.

212
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,980
Okay?

213
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,980
Between parent-child DNS servers.

214
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:56,980
And there's also a secure channel between the client and the first level DNS responder.

215
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:07,980
Now, there's also something called DNS over HTTP, network of HTTPS, it's called D-O-H, which essentially makes DNS clear to go over TLS SSL.

216
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:15,980
And if you dig into your browser, or your network setting, you might be able to find an option for that.

217
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,980
It's probably unclear, but you can force your browser to always use that.

218
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:26,980
But the idea is basically that all the messages are encrypted and mapped.

219
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,980
And mapped is the integrity message authentication code.

220
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,980
So, the encryption in the MAC are done with different keys, kind of like in itself derived from the same master key.

221
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,980
And yeah, and each message has a nonce, so there's no replaying, etc.

222
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,980
And the idea is that each DNS must share a symmetric master key with its family.

223
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,980
If you want to know more about it, here's an in-depth presentation.

224
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
Any questions about DNS?

225
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:06,980
I did not tell you about all possible attacks, because just DNS security by itself is probably like a half a quarter, five week course in and of itself.

226
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,980
This is, again, like everything in this course, kind of an appetizer.

227
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,980
No rushes?

228
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
Okay.

229
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,980
Well, that is the end of the net attacks.

230
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:38,980
Now we skip something completely different.

231
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,980
Now I'm going to talk about privacy in a minute.

232
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,980
So, you probably know a bit about this already.

233
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,980
It's hard to actually be an internet user and not know about it.

234
00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:00,980
And unless you live in a vacuum, you definitely hear all the time about attacks and leaks and threats.

235
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,980
So, privacy is kind of a long-standing problem or a long-standing concept.

236
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,980
By itself, privacy and anonymity have nothing to do with the digital world.

237
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,980
I mean, they exist in the analog world.

238
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,980
We all know what privacy means in the analog world.

239
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,980
Most of you should know what anonymity means, right?

240
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:27,980
Does anybody want to say what anonymity means in the physical world?

241
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,980
Any guesses?

242
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,980
You know the word, right?

243
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,980
What does that actually mean?

244
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,980
There's no wrong answer.

245
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,980
I'm not going to be judged.

246
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,980
Not identifiable.

247
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,980
Okay.

248
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
Not identifiable what?

249
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,980
Give me an example.

250
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
Maybe an example you have in mind.

251
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,980
On the physical world.

252
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
What is anonymity?

253
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:11,980
Well, there's a disturbance, some kind of a going on.

254
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,980
And maybe you've heard of like antifa protesters, right?

255
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,980
Or whenever there are protests on campus.

256
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Let's say, like the one we had last year.

257
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
I don't remember if we had masks.

258
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,980
But in many of those protests, people wear masks.

259
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Right?

260
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,980
Why do they wear masks?

261
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,980
To be anonymous.

262
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
We know they're there.

263
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
They're people, right?

264
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
They're people.

265
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Well, at least maybe for now, about years from now, they might be robots.

266
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,980
But today, we know they're people.

267
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
They're humans.

268
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,980
We might even be able to tell the gender.

269
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,980
Not always.

270
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,980
Height, maybe.

271
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,980
Weight, sort of.

272
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,980
But most identifying features are hidden, right?

273
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
When you wear a mask.

274
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,980
Put on a mask, a hat, pair of sunglasses.

275
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,980
Nobody can tell your eye color, your hair color.

276
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
Right?

277
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,980
The typical identification.

278
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,980
Oh, facial recognition doesn't work, right?

279
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,980
Be careful.

280
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,980
Not with a COVID mask.

281
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,980
With a COVID mask, it still works.

282
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,980
But a real, like a balaclava type mask won't work.

283
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Right?

284
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
That's anonymity.

285
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:28,980
When a bandit, you know, western style bandits will put a bandana on their face to rob a bank

286
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,980
or a stagecoach, like you've seen in some movies.

287
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
That's essentially what they want.

288
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
An anonymity.

289
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,980
Right?

290
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,980
It's not a question where they're robbers.

291
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,980
Right?

292
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,980
They're oil robbers.

293
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,980
You know how many there are.

294
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,980
But you don't know what they are, who they are.

295
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,980
That's anonymity.

296
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:54,980
If you are worried about privacy, and let's say you want to buy, I don't know, some, let's

297
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,980
say you are a crypto smoker.

298
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,980
You are a crypto smoker.

299
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,980
You don't smoke crypto.

300
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,980
I don't mean that.

301
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
No, crypto means hidden.

302
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,980
You're like, you don't want anybody to know who to smoke.

303
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,980
Okay?

304
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:12,980
So, you don't want the transaction to show up on your credit card, for example.

305
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,980
In fact, you bought cigarettes at 7-Eleven.

306
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,980
Or that you ordered them on the web, right?

307
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
So, what do you do in the physical world?

308
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,980
Well, you could.

309
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
You probably will not end well.

310
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:29,980
But you could put a paper bag over your head with a couple of holes for eyes.

311
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,980
Get some cash from the ATM somewhere else well before.

312
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,980
Walk in.

313
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,980
Say, don't worry, I'm not here to rob you.

314
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,980
I would like a pack of Marlboros.

315
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,980
Okay?

316
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,980
If the clerk is not scared of trickless, they will take your cash, give you a pack of Marlboros,

317
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,980
and off you go.

318
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,980
That's an anonymous transaction.

319
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,980
Cash is anonymous, right?

320
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
You are anonymous.

321
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,980
You could be wearing stilts to disguise your height.

322
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,980
You could be wearing, I don't know, you could bend your knees if you're wearing something

323
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,980
to disguise your height.

324
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,980
You could make yourself shorter.

325
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,980
You know, you could alter your voice.

326
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,980
And with a paper bag over your head, you're anonymous.

327
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
I know, it's silly.

328
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,980
But that's the idea of physical anonymity.

329
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,980
Okay?

330
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:27,980
The fact that someone bought cigarettes at that 7-Eleven is not disguised.

331
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,980
The question is, who bought cigarettes?

332
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,980
Well, somebody did.

333
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,980
But that somebody is indistinguishable from anybody outside, right?

334
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,980
Any number of people.

335
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,980
That's an anonymity.

336
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,980
And that's basically what an anonymity is in the digital world.

337
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
You'll see it.

338
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,980
But it's not the same thing for privacy.

339
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,980
Privacy is kind of, in the physical world, is the right to be left alone.

340
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,980
Okay?

341
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:57,980
So, there is a bit of a disconnect between the definition of privacy, the way that lawyers

342
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,980
define it in the physical world, and the way we see it on the internet.

343
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,980
And it's difficult to define.

344
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,980
So, I won't try to give you an overall definition of privacy.

345
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:17,980
But it is something that most people in the world, not everywhere, believe is like an individual

346
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,980
right and natural desire to have privacy.

347
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,980
I mean, right?

348
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,980
I mean, we have, I don't know, changing rooms for privacy, right?

349
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,980
We have bathrooms for, stalls for privacy, right?

350
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,980
We have tentative classrooms, you know, in some places for privacy.

351
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,980
I mean, lots of things we do in the real world are for privacy.

352
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:46,980
Now, privacy is relevant not just to individuals, right?

353
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,980
So far, everything I said is about individual privacy.

354
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,980
But it's also relevant to other entities like governments and groups and corporations.

355
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,980
And maybe it's obvious why.

356
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,980
Maybe not.

357
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,980
We'll see.

358
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:07,980
So, as the time goes by and sort of the internet is permeating everyday life for more and more

359
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,980
people, there's definitely globally an increase in awareness of privacy.

360
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,980
Although most people, if you ask them to define it, well, kind of like you guys, you can't

361
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,980
define really or not sure you can't, right?

362
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Give me a good definition of privacy.

363
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
I can't hide it.

364
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,980
But there is awareness of it.

365
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Privacy is important.

366
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,980
But if you ask people, and some researchers did surveys, opinions are all over the map

367
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,980
like what it means, what privacy means.

368
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,980
Okay?

369
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,980
It's also highly cultural and etc.

370
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,980
And so, I say it's both nebulous and fickle.

371
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,980
Nebulous means it's kind of, well, difficult to define.

372
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Fickle means it changes.

373
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,980
A lot of times people will say, well, you know, my privacy is important.

374
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,980
Like, if you give an example, what if this happens to you?

375
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,980
Do you become certain?

376
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
Yes.

377
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,980
What if it happens to somewhere else?

378
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,980
No.

379
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,980
So, privacy is a very personal thing.

380
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,980
We also live in a society that because of social networking, and this is the last 20

381
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,980
years, I think, right?

382
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,980
The beginning of social networking, about 20 years ago.

383
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:24,980
The whole idea of social networking promotes, among other things, good and bad, it promotes

384
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,980
lawyerism and exhibitionism.

385
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,980
If you don't know what those terms are, or do you?

386
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
Exhibitionism is just like, look at me.

387
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
I'm interesting.

388
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
Yes.

389
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,980
I bought a purse.

390
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,980
I bought a new bike.

391
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Look at me.

392
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
I'm on a vacation in Krakistan.

393
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,980
Look at me.

394
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
Next to the, you know, the Tower of Pisa.

395
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
Look at me in the Grand Canyon.

396
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
I'm so interested.

397
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:56,980
I'm not like those other 10,000 grad students who went on a Grand Canyon vacation as soon

398
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
as I got here.

399
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
So, this is the exhibitionism.

400
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,980
Voyeurism is the opposite.

401
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,980
The people who are actually looking at stuff because they have nothing better to do.

402
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,980
And, you know, in the extreme, do cyber stalking.

403
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,980
That's lawyers.

404
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,980
Anyway, so social networking, for better or for worse, promotes these kinds of things.

405
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,980
And, that's clearly not a good thing for privacy.

406
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,980
And, even worse, for anonymity, right?

407
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,980
So, how can you demand privacy if you post your pictures, you know, five times a day?

408
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,980
With geolocation.

409
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:34,980
Anyway, the amount of information, not just social networking type information.

410
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,980
The amount of information essentially disclosed on the internet, on the public internet, has

411
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,980
grown tremendously in the last 20 years.

412
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
Right?

413
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,980
Much more handling and transfer of sensing information occurs.

414
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:51,980
And, this is not, again, your own photos and blogs, vlogs and whatever else, right?

415
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,980
We're talking about sensitive medical information.

416
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:03,980
All kinds of records, official records, driver's licenses, marriages, divorces, lawsuits.

417
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,980
Everything is out there on the internet, right?

418
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,980
Whereas, 20 years ago, you would probably have a hard time finding a lot of this information.

419
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Anyway, you would have, it was available, mind you, but you would have to actually physically

420
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,980
search for it.

421
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,980
And, unfortunately, as a result of all this, there's much less privacy and accountability.

422
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,980
Now, we all recall that the internet was designed as a public good, right?

423
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,980
As a public resource.

424
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,980
So, complaining about lack of privacy on the internet is a bit silly, in a way.

425
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
Right?

426
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:45,980
We know that from the discussions about IP, TCP, et cetera, that most information on the internet

427
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,980
is, well, a lot of information is public, by default.

428
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Right?

429
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:59,980
So, an IP packet that you could snoop on easily, right, is possible to hide information in it.

430
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,980
If you use SSLTLS, everything will be hidden from after the transport layer header.

431
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,980
If you use IPsec, everything after the IP header will be hidden.

432
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:18,980
But, at the very least, because routing needs to happen on the public internet, the outermost IP headers are visible, aren't they?

433
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,980
Always.

434
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,980
Always, right?

435
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
A definition.

436
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,980
You have to route packets on the internet.

437
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,980
And, in the network layer, that means that there has to be an IP layer present.

438
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,980
Otherwise, that could get discarded or not even sent.

439
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,980
And recall what's in the IP header.

440
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,980
Well, among other things, in the IP header, there's source, destination, and the protocol.

441
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,980
The protocol says which is the transport layer protocol to use now.

442
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,980
Now, if you don't use IPsec, there's a lot more, right?

443
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:58,980
But, even if you use IPsec, the outermost header, at the very least, tells you the IP addresses of IPsec gateways.

444
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,980
Right?

445
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,980
Remember these IPsecs?

446
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,980
You can build tunnels, right?

447
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,980
So, even if you hide the end posts, right?

448
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:16,980
You have an organization on, say, two campuses of the same organization on different places on the internet.

449
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,980
Alice is in one campus talking to B in another campus.

450
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
That's fine.

451
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,980
Nobody in the middle of the internet can see that Alice is talking to Bob.

452
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,980
But, everybody can see that Campus 1 is talking to Campus 2.

453
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980
Right?

454
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,980
Someone on this campus is talking to someone on this campus.

455
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Because the addresses of the IP gateways, right?

456
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,980
The border gateways will tell you.

457
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,980
You might not think that's a lot of information, but it is.

458
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,980
Also, the frequency of packets.

459
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,980
Right?

460
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,980
The timing of packets is important.

461
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,980
It leaks information.

462
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
Okay?

463
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:01,980
For example, if you have, let's say you have the following situation.

464
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,980
You have a transit autonomous system.

465
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,980
Right?

466
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,980
Remember we talked about autonomous systems.

467
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,980
And there's a transit provider, right?

468
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,980
Provides transit service.

469
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,980
And it serves two companies.

470
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,980
Now we talk about two companies, not two campuses at the same.

471
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,980
Two companies in AFD.

472
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:26,980
Normally, the transit service provider does not observe much traffic between AFD.

473
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,980
Okay?

474
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,980
It does not.

475
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,980
All of a sudden, there is a spike in IPsec traffic.

476
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,980
Now what could it be?

477
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:42,980
AFD are companies that are registered, so you can look up what they are in the real world.

478
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,980
Let's say one of them is a pharmaceutical company.

479
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,980
Another one is a pharmaceutical startup.

480
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,980
Okay?

481
00:34:52,980 --> 00:35:00,980
What could you possibly conclude when the traffic spikes between a large pharmaceutical company

482
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,980
and a pharmaceutical startup?

483
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,980
Probably.

484
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,980
Probably something is going on between these.

485
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,980
One is going to probably swallow the other.

486
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,980
That's privileged information.

487
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,980
That's kind of insider information.

488
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
Why?

489
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,980
You don't know what the hell they are talking about.

490
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,980
But you know when.

491
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,980
Huh?

492
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
You know when.

493
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
And you know how much a person will do.

494
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,980
Now they could always pretend to send more traffic than they actually have to send, right?

495
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
By just sending garbage.

496
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,980
But they cannot send less.

497
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,980
And obscuring timing.

498
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
How do they obscure timing?

499
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,980
If the negotiations happen in the middle of the night.

500
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Ah.

501
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,980
That might also be an interesting thing.

502
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,980
Okay?

503
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,980
It's urgent.

504
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,980
Then it's time to invest.

505
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,980
Or buy some shares of that smaller startup.

506
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Or of the bigger one.

507
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
And you can make some money.

508
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,980
While others won't.

509
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
Do you see that?

510
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,980
Where I'm going with this.

511
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,980
Okay?

512
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,980
Or all of a sudden you have the US government.

513
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,980
Department of State.

514
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,980
Okay?

515
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,980
That never sends much traffic to its embassy in Zimbabwe.

516
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:22,980
And all of a sudden you notice as a transit provider that there's like a giant spider.

517
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,980
What's going on?

518
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
Huh?

519
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,980
Maybe there's a coup in Zimbabwe.

520
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,980
Happens.

521
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,980
Maybe there's a military action that is being planned.

522
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,980
That's information.

523
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
Right?

524
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,980
So that's valuable information.

525
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,980
Anyway.

526
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
As I said before.

527
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Encryption doesn't solve this problem.

528
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
Right?

529
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:56,980
Encryption is not enough for anonymity or even real privacy.

530
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,980
What are applications of anonymity?

531
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
Well.

532
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,980
Hiding transactions.

533
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
Hiding transactions.

534
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
You know.

535
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,980
If we had, for example, electronic cash.

536
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Anybody ever heard of electronic cash?

537
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
It exists.

538
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
It's a concept.

539
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,980
If you took an advanced crypto class you may have heard of electronic cash.

540
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:28,980
But I used to give a lecture on it like 10, 12 years ago but now it's becoming obsolete.

541
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,980
But electronic cash is essentially the idea is to replicate physical cash in electronic

542
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,980
form.

543
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,980
And by the way, cryptocurrencies are not, are not cash.

544
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,980
You know that right?

545
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
Why not?

546
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,980
Why not?

547
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:51,980
Because cryptocurrencies have wallets and have owners and so there's no truly anonymous

548
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
cryptocurrency.

549
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,980
What cryptocurrencies give you is what's called pseudonymity.

550
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,980
Like when you, yeah.

551
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,980
But there's cold wallets.

552
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,980
They can just give you this crypto.

553
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,980
Yes.

554
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,980
But the wallet is a wallet.

555
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:12,980
You cannot transform one wallet magically into another wallet that is not linkable.

556
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,980
You see, you get a wallet, it stays a wallet.

557
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,980
So, now I don't know who's behind it.

558
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,980
I don't know it's you or him or anybody else.

559
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:25,980
What I do know is what it receives and what it sends, right?

560
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Like most cryptocurrencies, I don't claim to know a lot about cryptocurrencies, okay?

561
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:37,980
But most of them will function on this premise of like wallets where you accumulate a specific

562
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,980
cryptocurrency.

563
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:44,980
If you are, but if you go with like a big provider like Coinbase or something like that,

564
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,980
they aggregate those wallets for you, okay?

565
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:54,980
But if you're an individual in a cryptocurrency trader or investor, you have typically this

566
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,980
number of wallets.

567
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,980
You have a Bitcoin wallet, an Ethereum wallet, and they all have addresses.

568
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:08,980
Now, the link between an address and a human being, that's something that, you know, not

569
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
given, right?

570
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,980
It's difficult to establish who that is.

571
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:19,980
But what wallets have this form, the term is persistent identifiers, that wallet ID,

572
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,980
which is like some kind of binary string, right?

573
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,980
And they're unique.

574
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,980
And because of that, there is no actual anonymity because you can link all the transactions to

575
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,980
that wallet.

576
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
You know exactly what that wallet is doing.

577
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,980
Sending so much money, receiving so much money.

578
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:41,980
You know, one of the problems, we haven't talked about ransomware, but when an organization

579
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:47,980
gets hit by ransomware and they pay the ransom, it's very clear to whom they're paying.

580
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,980
A specific wallet, right?

581
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,980
Because ransomware loves, the attackers, ransomware attackers, they love Bitcoin and other types

582
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
of cryptocurrencies.

583
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,980
And they give you an ID, usually.

584
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:05,980
If you've seen like a ransom message that follows, usually follows the ransomware attack,

585
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,980
it says, transfer money here.

586
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,980
And they give you the explicit ID.

587
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
But you don't know who that is.

588
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,980
It's very hard to find out who.

589
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,980
But it's still not anonymity.

590
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:28,980
Anyway, so online payment, sometimes you want to browse anonymously, right?

591
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,980
You know, in graduate school people do research.

592
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Sometimes research requires looking at sites that are not pleasant.

593
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Okay?

594
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,980
For example, in my group some years ago, we had to go to some particular porn site.

595
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,980
Okay.

596
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,980
Why?

597
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,980
Because we were studying CAPTCHAs.

598
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,980
And that porn site, the way it worked, it was free.

599
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,980
But to get access to it, you had to solve a CAPTCHA.

600
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:05,980
But really cleverly, what it was doing, it was specifically making the users of that porn

601
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,980
site function as human CAPTCHA solvers for a bot.

602
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,980
Maybe that doesn't make sense here.

603
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:20,980
So, there was a bot operator, okay, that was creating Facebook and Gmail accounts, okay?

604
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,980
And Instagram accounts.

605
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,980
Now, normally these bots, what they do is they automate, right?

606
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,980
Create an account, provide a password, select a user ID, fill in the password, etc.

607
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:38,980
But then, all these Instagram, Facebook, Google, they have CAPTCHAs, right?

608
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,980
They say, prove you're a human before we create an account.

609
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,980
You see what I'm saying?

610
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,980
But the bot that operated is not human.

611
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:53,980
So, what they were doing is that they made a partnership with a porn site, where every

612
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:59,980
time, when they wanted to create an account, and a CAPTCHA popped out, they sent this CAPTCHA

613
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,980
to the porn site, okay?

614
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,980
That presented that CAPTCHA to the next user.

615
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,980
And so, with a high enough volume of traffic, there was always somebody trying to get access

616
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,980
to the porn site.

617
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,980
They would pop up with a CAPTCHA, the user would solve it quickly, the solution would

618
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:20,980
come back to the bot, and it would feed it into Gmail, Instagram, Facebook, okay?

619
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,980
So, long story short, let's come back.

620
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,980
Yes, so we had to look at that particular porn site a couple of times, you know, so, you

621
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:33,980
don't want to do it from university computers, right?

622
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,980
So, you do use anonymous browsing, okay?

623
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:43,980
That essentially hides your browsing patterns.

624
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:50,980
So, if you're using standard browsers, what you're browsing is not private, generally.

625
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,980
I mean, some of them are more private than others.

626
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,980
I mean, yes, Safari is better than Firefox, and nothing is worse than even the Explorer,

627
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,980
but then there is DuckDuckGo, and Brave, and they all pretend to be very private, et cetera,

628
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,980
but they're actually not very private.

629
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,980
If you want private, you use the Tor browser, okay?

630
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,980
I will talk about Tor in a second.

631
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:19,980
Okay, so web browsing, you want to look up a site, even something innocuous, like you

632
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,980
totally, like you want to price out a certain item, right?

633
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,980
You're looking for, I don't know, a refrigerator, or a pair of shoes.

634
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,980
You don't want to get ads, okay?

635
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:34,980
You don't want to pollute yourself with all this information that will incessantly pop

636
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,980
out ads about shoes or refrigerators.

637
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,980
So, anonymous browsing is good for that.

638
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,980
You want to use a search engine, too.

639
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:49,980
You don't want a search engine, like Gmail, or Google, or Bing, or whatever, to know your

640
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,980
search patterns.

641
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:56,980
Sometimes you want to send an untraceable message, an untraceable email, because maybe

642
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,980
you are a whistleblower, corporate or government whistleblower, and you would like to report

643
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,980
something criminal or some abuse anonymously.

644
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,980
Well, hell, even here at UCI, we have a way to do so, by the way.

645
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:17,980
We also, I mean, we have it in the physical world, there's an Office of the Ombudsman to

646
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,980
which you can report things anonymously.

647
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,980
But we also, last time I checked, a couple years ago, there was a way to anonymously send

648
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,980
email, except it's not truly anonymous.

649
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:33,980
I mean, there's a way to basically use a web form, okay, to send an anonymously.

650
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:43,980
If you're a dissident, a political dissident in an oppressive society, maybe this is socially

651
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,980
sensitive communication about, let's say, addiction.

652
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,980
You know, groups like Alcoholics Anonymous or people with sexually transmitted diseases

653
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,980
who form mutual support groups, and you certainly don't want your friends and family or your

654
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,980
co-workers to know about your participation in such groups.

655
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,980
So, that's why privacy is super important.

656
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:08,980
Also, on the business side, if you have confidential business negotiations, for example, the previous

657
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,980
thing I said about, you know, two companies have, you know, a startup and a big pharmaceutical

658
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,980
engaging in intensive communications.

659
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,980
That's, again, where you need privacy.

660
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:23,980
And, last but not least, even law enforcement, which you would think normally is against privacy,

661
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,980
because, you know, it's fundamentally, like, about uncovering things.

662
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,980
Even they benefit from privacy.

663
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:39,980
When they mount sting operations and set up honeypots for all kinds of miscreants out there.

664
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,980
When they do secretly communicating in the public network.

665
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:48,980
Like, for example, you know, with informers, secret informers or secret agents.

666
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:54,980
As I said, okay, I already said digital cash.

667
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,980
Also, anonymous electronic voting.

668
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,980
One day, I hope, in not too distant future, we will have internet voting.

669
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,980
Might not happen for a while, but I hope it will.

670
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:10,980
Because it will definitely raise, lower the barriers for voting participation.

671
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,980
And, just like we vote today, sort of anonymously, right?

672
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:20,980
It would be nice to vote better anonymously on the internet.

673
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,980
But, secure.

674
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,980
So, the idea is not to give up on security.

675
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:30,980
The idea is to still have secure voting, but in a way that's anonymous.

676
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,980
Okay?

677
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,980
Today, is the voting anonymous?

678
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,980
No.

679
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,980
Why do you say that?

680
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,980
No, I'm just curious about your intuition.

681
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:50,980
Because the ballot, it has your name on it.

682
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,980
Does it?

683
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,980
Yeah.

684
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,980
When is it?

685
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,980
Did somebody vote recently?

686
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,980
Yeah, I voted in November.

687
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,980
In November.

688
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,980
And your ballot had a name.

689
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,980
Did you vote by mail?

690
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,980
No.

691
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,980
In person?

692
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,980
Yeah.

693
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:06,980
Okay.

694
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,980
I vote by mail, generally.

695
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,980
So, my ballot had no name.

696
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,980
The envelope is the problem.

697
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,980
Also, I have no proof, actually, that the ballot had no name.

698
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,980
It could have had a watermark that I didn't see.

699
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,980
You see, the problem in the physical world, we put a lot of faith in, like, yeah, it's

700
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,980
supposed to be anonymous.

701
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:28,980
But, when you go into a precinct, so you went to a precinct, and then, did they check

702
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:29,980
your ID?

703
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,980
No.

704
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,980
Right, because it's not, that law is not here yet.

705
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,980
The government is trying to make it, make it come to life.

706
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,980
But, did they check your name on the roster?

707
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,980
Yeah.

708
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,980
So, somebody knows if you're voted, right?

709
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,980
Yeah.

710
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,980
So, the thing is, even if the ballot isn't anonymous, sorry, is anonymous, if the ballot

711
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:58,980
is anonymous, somebody, the precinct worker, crossed your name, and said, uh-huh, he or

712
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,980
she voted, right?

713
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,980
So, that's already, like, you're sacrificing privacy, right?

714
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,980
You cannot say, I'm not saying I voted, I didn't vote.

715
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,980
No.

716
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,980
You voted.

717
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,980
You voted.

718
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,980
If someone voted, it's actually public, right?

719
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,980
It is, but should it be?

720
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:14,980
I understand.

721
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,980
Should it be?

722
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:25,980
Also, what if he walked in, got his name checked, went inside the ballot's, uh, what

723
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,980
is it called?

724
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,980
A tent, right?

725
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,980
It's like a, it's like a changing room, right?

726
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,980
And never voted, and walked out.

727
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,980
Good, right?

728
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,980
I've heard of people doing that.

729
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,980
Anyway, voting is interesting, and also it's censorship-resistant publishing.

730
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,980
That is, publishing, there's something, or putting something on, let's say, on the web,

731
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,980
they cannot be taken down, because nobody knows where it is.

732
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:53,980
Imagine that.

733
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:58,980
You have something to say, maybe it's good, maybe it's bad, okay?

734
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,980
Censorship does not distinguish between good and bad things.

735
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,980
You have something to say, somebody, or, let's say, the government hates it, and wants

736
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,980
it taken down, but they can't, because they don't know where it is.

737
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:14,980
That's called censorship-resistant publishing.

738
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:19,980
Oh, of course, where there's good, there's bad, and this is the problem right away that

739
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,980
should be, it should be obvious to you, that anonymity has two sides, okay?

740
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,980
Very much depends on which side you look from.

741
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,980
The usual thing, right?

742
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,980
If you have anonymity, it will be abused.

743
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:38,980
There's no way to separate anonymity for the good from anonymity for the bad.

744
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:45,980
All kinds of things, misinformation, propaganda, illegal substances, right?

745
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,980
All kinds of illegal, murder for hire, sure.

746
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,980
Chemical weapons, sure.

747
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,980
Poisons, yeah.

748
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:02,980
Drugs, probably most of you are too young to remember the Silk Road.

749
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,980
If you look up Silk Road, that was a marketplace.

750
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,980
There was a whole marketplace for illegal substances and illegal activities.

751
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:17,980
The guy who ran it, there was even a movie about it, I think Ross Obrecht was his name.

752
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,980
I think the president pardoned him recently.

753
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:26,980
He was serving a very lengthy jail sentence in a federal prison.

754
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,980
But anyway, that was taken down.

755
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:34,980
But there are other marketplaces out there for illegal substances and illegal acts.

756
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,980
And they cannot be taken down because the way they operate is beyond the reach of the law.

757
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,980
Because of anonymity.

758
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,980
Tax avoidance, yes.

759
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:52,980
There are some cryptocurrency tricks that try to circumvent the anonymity I mentioned earlier.

760
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,980
And also just general incitement to criminal activity.

761
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:03,980
Let's say you want to use censorship resistant publishing that I mentioned earlier on the previous slide for the purposes of inciting terrorism.

762
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,980
Well, your opinion is terrorism is legit.

763
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,980
And the government is trying to censor you by attempting to take it down.

764
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,980
Well, one person in terrorism is another person in freedom of fire.

765
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:17,980
Or you want to incite murder.

766
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,980
Or you want to incite genocide.

767
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,980
Sure.

768
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,980
That's freedom of speech for some.

769
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,980
And prohibited pain speech for others.

770
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,980
So, anonymity has two sides.

771
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:30,980
But what is it really?

772
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,980
Let's try to begin.

773
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:39,980
I'm going to try to say that it's like inability to identify someone.

774
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:45,980
An inability to identify someone with something within a set of subjects.

775
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:49,980
Now, the size of the set can vary.

776
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:56,980
And the fewer subjects in a set, the worse anonymity is, right?

777
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:06,980
So, if I turn my back to the board and somebody throws a spitball at my back, surely some of you have done this in high school,

778
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,980
I will know that somebody threw a spitball at me.

779
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,980
I will feel it.

780
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,980
I'm sensitive.

781
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,980
But there are 14 people here.

782
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,980
Which one?

783
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,980
Is it the guy who is smiling?

784
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,980
Or is it somebody with a poker face?

785
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,980
Is it the person pretending to type on their phone?

786
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,980
Or actually typing on their phone?

787
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,980
Pretending to be very occupied or looking up in the sky?

788
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,980
I have no idea.

789
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,980
That's anonymity.

790
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,980
You throw a spitball at me when my back is turned.

791
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,980
I don't have eyes in the back of my head.

792
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,980
You are anonymous in a group of 14.

793
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,980
Okay?

794
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,980
Now, if there are two of you here, wow, my job is easier.

795
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:54,980
I might look at your fingers and, you know, or something.

796
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,980
But, yeah, 14 is good enough for that.

797
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,980
So, different from privacy, right?

798
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:09,980
In other words, one cannot be anonymous alone, right?

799
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:15,980
So, if there is one only person here and I feel the spitball hitting my back, I don't know this.

800
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,980
That's definitely the culprit.

801
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,980
That's it.

802
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,980
There is other shades of anonymity.

803
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:27,980
One is called unlinkability and the other we call unobservability.

804
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,980
Okay?

805
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:34,980
Unlinkability is an inability to connect multiple actions or action and identity.

806
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:42,980
Like, in the spitball example, I also get more than anonymity, I get unlinkability.

807
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,980
The action was spitball.

808
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:49,980
But I cannot link an identity to that action.

809
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,980
I know it's someone, but I cannot link an identity.

810
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,980
Do you see this?

811
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,980
Do you see this?

812
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,980
The action occurred.

813
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,980
I know the action occurred.

814
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,980
Spitball hit me.

815
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,980
Somebody launched it.

816
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,980
But who?

817
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,980
I don't know.

818
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,980
So, I can't link.

819
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,980
Or, suppose this.

820
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,980
Twice this happened.

821
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:06,980
Twice.

822
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,980
My back is turned.

823
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,980
Bam!

824
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:09,980
Spitball.

825
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:10,980
Some minutes later, my back is turned again.

826
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:11,980
Bam!

827
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,980
Another spitball.

828
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,980
Okay.

829
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:14,980
I know.

830
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,980
Two spitballs.

831
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:16,980
But let's say this guy, I want to hit me.

832
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,980
Hit me.

833
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:18,980
Hit me.

834
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,980
Somebody launched it.

835
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,980
But who?

836
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,980
I don't know.

837
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:22,980
So, I can't link.

838
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,980
Or, suppose this.

839
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,980
Twice this happened.

840
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,980
Twice.

841
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,980
Twice.

842
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,980
My back is turned.

843
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:28,980
Bam!

844
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,980
Let's say this guy over here.

845
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,980
Let's meet him a little seeker.

846
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:37,980
He says, you know, it's the same person.

847
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,980
Snitch.

848
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,980
That means I have linkability.

849
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,980
I just linked.

850
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,980
I don't know who it is, but I know it's the same person.

851
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,980
You see?

852
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,980
But if he doesn't tell me, I know that two actions occurred, but I can't link them.

853
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,980
I mean, they asked spitballs.

854
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,980
Both.

855
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,980
But it could have been done by two different people.

856
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:00,980
So, inability to link is unlinkability.

857
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,980
If he rats on somebody, it's just partially rats on somebody.

858
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,980
You know, it's the same person.

859
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:06,980
All I can tell you is the same person.

860
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,980
Oh, now I have more information.

861
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,980
There's one person.

862
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,980
It was not a random act.

863
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,980
That one person did it twice.

864
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,980
Okay?

865
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:21,980
So, a more appropriate example, perhaps, is connecting Alice to a sent email.

866
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,980
Now, I know that email was sent, right?

867
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,980
And if I can't link it to the sender, that's unlinkability.

868
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,980
But if I can link it to Alice, then I know Alice sent email.

869
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,980
I might not know what it is.

870
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:40,980
It might be well encrypted, but I know she sent email.

871
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,980
Or, I see two emails, both encrypted.

872
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,980
I don't know who sent them, but I know it's the same sender.

873
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,980
Okay?

874
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,980
That's linkability.

875
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,980
Inability to do that is unlinkable.

876
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:02,980
And then, last, sort of, the impacts of anonymity is called unobservability.

877
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,980
And that's very hard to achieve.

878
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:13,980
Here, if you observe, you don't know when a second action took place.

879
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:14,980
Okay?

880
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:20,980
So, let's say the room is completely dark.

881
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,980
Okay?

882
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,980
The room is completely dark.

883
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,980
You cannot see me.

884
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,980
I cannot see you, but I know you're here.

885
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,980
So, imagine right now all the lights go dark.

886
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,980
It's completely dark.

887
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:35,980
And then, 30 seconds later, the lights go on.

888
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:40,980
My question is, did somebody throw a spitball anywhere?

889
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,980
I didn't feel it, but did somebody do throw a spitball anywhere in the room?

890
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,980
I don't know.

891
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:50,980
Maybe.

892
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,980
Maybe not.

893
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,980
Do you see the difference?

894
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:58,980
An action may have occurred, or may not have occurred, I don't know.

895
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:04,980
So, that inability to tell what happened, just that the action happened, is, by itself,

896
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,980
unobservability.

897
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,980
That's really hard.

898
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:18,980
So, how do you undermine anonymity, well, by now it should be kind of obvious, right?

899
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,980
Passive traffic analysis.

900
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,980
Looking at IP traffic.

901
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,980
Looking at Ethernet traffic.

902
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,980
Why Ethernet?

903
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,980
Why Ethernet?

904
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:34,980
Well, at the MAC layer, you still see, remember, MAC addresses, right?

905
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,980
Even if, because, let's say, in a wireless menu, we use encryption, right?

906
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,980
There's wireless encryption, right?

907
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,980
There's wireless encryption protocols.

908
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,980
So, they hide even the IP header.

909
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,980
If you're confused, why am I saying this?

910
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:53,980
Because, remember, IP packets, once they go on the internet, once they usually pass the

911
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,980
first wireless hop, right?

912
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,980
They are IP packets.

913
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,980
Meaning, that you can see the heads, right?

914
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,980
You can see IP, you know, IP heads.

915
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,980
But, on our first wireless hop, right?

916
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:14,980
Like this, from here, from here to the access point, there's usually a wireless security protocol

917
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:24,980
that encrypts the IP packet between my device and the access point.

918
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:31,980
So, if you were observing traffic, what you would be able to see, then, is Ethernet headers.

919
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,980
Meaning, MAC addresses, right?

920
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,980
Source, destination.

921
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,980
But, that's also information, right?

922
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:43,980
Because, you can tell that it's, if you know the source, you'll know it's my phone

923
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,980
that's using that MAC address.

924
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,980
The destination will be access point.

925
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,980
But, if we're using, what is it called?

926
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,980
Direct Wi-Fi?

927
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,980
But, no direct Wi-Fi.

928
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,980
Appear Wi-Fi.

929
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,980
That's what you don't have access point.

930
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:00,980
But, let's say, talk directly, like me talking directly to his laptop.

931
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,980
We can do that.

932
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:03,980
Not easy to set up.

933
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,980
Not a lot of people use it, but you can, right?

934
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:11,980
So, in that case, if you snoop on traffic, you will be able to observe that my Ethernet MAC address

935
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,980
is talking to his Ethernet MAC address.

936
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,980
So, that's passive traffic analysis, right?

937
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:26,980
So, the idea is, if you want to hide patterns in traffic, you have to not only communicate

938
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,980
sparingly, but you also have to carry other people's traffic.

939
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:33,980
Like, relay other people's traffic to obscure patterns.

940
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,980
And, we'll see how that's done later.

941
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,980
There's more.

942
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:42,980
There's also active traffic analysis, which means injecting traffic and seeing if I can

943
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,980
recognize it as it traverses some route.

944
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,980
Put it on timing signatures.

945
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,980
That's later.

946
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:57,980
You can also, if you compromise routers, well, then you don't need to worry about snooping on traffic, right?

947
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:01,980
Routers, by definition, receive traffic and forward it.

948
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,980
So, they don't need to tap any wires or any kind of medium, right?

949
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,980
They naturally receive traffic and send it on its way.

950
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,980
And, you will never know if a router is compromised, right?

951
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:23,980
Because it's running malicious software that actually logs or examines communication patterns.

952
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:29,980
That's done silently.

953
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,980
So, from history.

954
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:40,980
Back in 1981, ancient history, 44 years ago, a guy named David Chow, a brilliantly paranoid

955
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:46,980
and crazy person who might have sort of dubious pleasure of meeting a few times.

956
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,980
Because brilliant scientists are always very nice people.

957
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,980
And, this guy's an example.

958
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:56,980
But, he's brilliant and should get a Turing Award.

959
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,980
He's old, but he's alive.

960
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,980
And, actually, should get a Turing Award one of his years.

961
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,980
He published several papers.

962
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,980
One of them was a communication with ACM called untraceable electronic mail return addresses

963
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,980
and digital series.

964
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:17,980
Mind you, 1981 was, should, I was in middle school, high school.

965
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:18,980
I mean, internet.

966
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,980
I had never heard of the internet.

967
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:27,980
So, that was only like maybe 81 and maybe a few thousand people around the world that knew of internet.

968
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:34,980
And, this guy was already thinking ahead about the world we live today.

969
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,980
Because, back then nobody cared about that anonymity.

970
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,980
So, you say, security?

971
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,980
Why?

972
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:40,980
Anonymity?

973
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:41,980
Who needs it?

974
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:48,980
But, that paper was laid the foundation for what today's, what today's anonymity and privacy tools are.

975
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:56,980
And, basically, the idea he laid out is that, he first made an argument why we need privacy and anonymity.

976
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:02,980
And, then he sort of used this new concept called public encryption because public encryption was run from like late 70s.

977
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:09,980
So, he used this very new cryptographic concept of public encryption with the concept of a trusted remailer.

978
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,980
called the mix.

979
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,980
Okay?

980
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:18,980
And, just, mix works like this.

981
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,980
And, it's the foundation actually.

982
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,980
It is the foundation of many, of today's anonymity systems.

983
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,980
So, the idea is this.

984
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,980
You have a bunch of users.

985
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,980
And, the users want to send email to each other.

986
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:37,980
So, now we're talking strictly about email because, back in the 1980s, there was no social networking.

987
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,980
There was no instant messaging.

988
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:40,980
There was no SMS.

989
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,980
There was no cell phones, really.

990
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,980
So, people communicated.

991
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:47,980
If they wanted to communicate electronically, they communicated via email.

992
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:50,980
And, the email looked pretty much like a dozen.

993
01:02:50,980 --> 01:03:00,980
So, the idea is to obscure or hide who is sending email to whom.

994
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,980
Okay?

995
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:08,980
So, we have A, C, D of Alice, Charlie, David, and then we have Bob and Eve.

996
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,980
And, these are all users.

997
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,980
And, some of them want to send email to others.

998
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:21,980
But, they don't want anybody observing that, anybody observing where that email goes.

999
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:29,980
So, you have here Alice, who wants to send an email to Bob.

1000
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:35,980
But, she does not send it directly to Bob because, if she did, that would be observable.

1001
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:42,980
So, what she does is, she takes the message that she wants to send to Bob, called M.

1002
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:50,980
Combines it with a NOS, a random value that she picks, R0.

1003
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:57,980
And, she encrypts it under the public key of Bob, the receiver.

1004
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:00,980
And, she takes the result, the encryption.

1005
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:03,980
Combines it with another NOS, called R1.

1006
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:04,980
Okay?

1007
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:17,980
Appends the name of the recipient, B, and encrypts it under the well-known public key of the mix.

1008
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,980
Now, the mix is not like the picture.

1009
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,980
It's a computer.

1010
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:27,980
And, its job is to mix email.

1011
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:29,980
But, it doesn't just mix.

1012
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,980
It also decrypts and decrypts, et cetera.

1013
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,980
But, in this example, you'll see.

1014
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:39,980
So, now, A, instead of sending to, directly to Bob, Alice sends it to the mix.

1015
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:50,980
Now, the idea is that when the mix gets that email, it knows that all the emails coming to the mix are encrypted under the mix of public key.

1016
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:51,980
Right?

1017
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:52,980
So, it tries to decrypt it.

1018
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,980
It doesn't succeed.

1019
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,980
It throws it away.

1020
01:04:54,980 --> 01:05:01,980
But, when it decrypts, what it finds inside is R0 and M encrypted, which you cannot read what it is.

1021
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,980
It doesn't see what M is.

1022
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:04,980
It doesn't know what R0 is.

1023
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:08,980
But, he sees the name of B, Bob, right?

1024
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,980
So, he says, that's what I'm going to send.

1025
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:13,980
Whatever I find inside, I'm going to send to Bob.

1026
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,980
You see that?

1027
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,980
Easy.

1028
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,980
And, he does that.

1029
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,980
Now, imagine you are the observer.

1030
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,980
And, you have seen that message from Alice to the mix.

1031
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:31,980
And, you have also seen the message from mix to Bob.

1032
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:36,980
Can you say for sure that these are the same messages?

1033
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:39,980
What can you tell me?

1034
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:40,980
What can you tell me?

1035
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,980
If there's no other messages, there's no message.

1036
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:44,980
Right.

1037
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:50,980
But, if somebody showed up and said, here's one message, here's the second message.

1038
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,980
Are they the same?

1039
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,980
Can you tell them?

1040
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:55,980
Huh?

1041
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:56,980
No.

1042
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:57,980
You cannot.

1043
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:58,980
Right?

1044
01:05:58,980 --> 01:05:59,980
You cannot.

1045
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,980
Because, how do you know?

1046
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,980
If this message is encrypted under the big public key of the mix, and the other message

1047
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,980
is encrypted under the public key of Bob.

1048
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:04,980
You cannot.

1049
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:05,980
You cannot.

1050
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:06,980
Right?

1051
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:07,980
You cannot.

1052
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:08,980
Because, how do you know?

1053
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:14,980
If this message is encrypted under the big public key of the mix, and the other message

1054
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:20,980
is encrypted under the public key of Bob.

1055
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:21,980
You cannot correlate.

1056
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:22,980
You cannot correlate.

1057
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,980
But, you are correct if you also know that this message was the only message coming into

1058
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:28,980
the mix.

1059
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:34,980
And, very soon afterwards, that message was encrypted, and very likely they had the same

1060
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,980
message.

1061
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:41,980
Because the mix sent only one message, and before that he received this one message, it

1062
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,980
must be a chain reaction, right?

1063
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,980
Well, that's not how we use a mix, right?

1064
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:47,980
You can imagine.

1065
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:51,980
The idea of a mix is to mix things.

1066
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:58,980
So, a mix is to receive many emails like this.

1067
01:06:58,980 --> 01:06:59,980
Okay?

1068
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,980
Now, this is a toy example, mind you.

1069
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:07,980
In the real world, this would be hundreds and maybe thousands of messages received in

1070
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,980
very close succession, right?

1071
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:13,980
One after another, or nearly simultaneously.

1072
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,980
So, look at what happens.

1073
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,980
In this example, there are only three incoming messages.

1074
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:21,980
Charlie wants to send a message to Eve.

1075
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:24,980
He encrypts it similarly, you see?

1076
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:27,980
David wants to send a message to Bob.

1077
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:28,980
He encrypts it similarly, right?

1078
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:33,980
Everything is the same format, right?

1079
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:44,980
And what the mix actually does is output the three messages in a blast at the same time.

1080
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,980
Or you can imagine either at the same time or in some random order.

1081
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:52,980
But the order in which it outputs, it has nothing to do with the order in which it received.

1082
01:07:52,980 --> 01:08:01,980
Now, you're again the observer who sees what's coming into the mix and what is leaving the mix.

1083
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,980
Can you map incoming to outgoing messages?

1084
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:08,980
Probabilistically?

1085
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,980
Only probabilistically, yeah.

1086
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,980
This is a silly example, right?

1087
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,980
Can you say, who sent a message to Eve?

1088
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:20,980
Well, it could be one-third, right?

1089
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:21,980
Probability.

1090
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,980
It's either Alice, Charlie, or David.

1091
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,980
Who sends a message to Bob?

1092
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:34,980
Well, it's either Alice and Charlie, Alice and David, or Charlie and David, right?

1093
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,980
You know everybody sent a message.

1094
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,980
What you don't know is to whom.

1095
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:46,980
But now, think about generalizing this to hundreds of messages and thousands of messages.

1096
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,980
And many thousands of recipients.

1097
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:50,980
Right?

1098
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,980
Both senders and receivers.

1099
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,980
Then it becomes very difficult to associate.

1100
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:01,980
So the main thing is that, of course, the mix does not need three messages to start sending.

1101
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,980
It needs to receive a patch that is big enough.

1102
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:05,980
Right?

1103
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,980
And that's configurable and you can set it to like 10,000.

1104
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:12,980
So, a mix receives 10,000 messages, then it outputs them in random form.

1105
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:13,980
Yeah?

1106
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:18,980
Can you just see that Alice is always in a batch that sends a message to Bob, but whenever

1107
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,980
there's a batch to Alice, it doesn't make me never send a message to Bob.

1108
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:23,980
Yes.

1109
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:25,980
Yes.

1110
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:26,980
You can.

1111
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:31,980
And then, maybe you can think, you can deduce that Alice did not send a message to Bob,

1112
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,980
or she did send a message to Bob at some point.

1113
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:34,980
Yes.

1114
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:39,980
But, again, with a large enough scaling factor, this should be really, really difficult.

1115
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:44,980
I imagine there's some endpoints that never get message sent in the ticker.

1116
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:45,980
Aha!

1117
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:46,980
Yes.

1118
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:47,980
And there are defenses against that as well.

1119
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:49,980
Okay?

1120
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:57,980
In the general system, what happens is, I mean, this is like if you want to maximize or minimize

1121
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:58,980
kind of the performance levels.

1122
01:09:58,980 --> 01:09:59,980
You do this.

1123
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:04,980
You output as many messages as a mix, output as many messages as you see.

1124
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:13,980
There are also very naive or nothing, very intuitive strategies to obscure and prevent attacks

1125
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:14,980
like you just have.

1126
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:19,980
And they involve chaffing or generating spurious traffic.

1127
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:28,980
So the idea is that every user of the mix will randomly send traffic that goes nowhere.

1128
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,980
You see what I'm saying?

1129
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:32,980
Yes.

1130
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:33,980
Right?

1131
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,980
It will just send traffic to a special destination called X.

1132
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,980
And there's no X.

1133
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:46,980
So when the mix receives a packet and receives a message, decrypts it, and she sees destination

1134
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,980
X, it says, oh, this is chaff.

1135
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:49,980
Throw it.

1136
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:50,980
Okay?

1137
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:57,980
So that says that Alice, that obscures the true number of packets or mail messages that

1138
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,980
Alice sends or every user sends.

1139
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:06,980
In addition to that, a mix can generate spurious messages to random destinations as well.

1140
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,980
A chaff, right?

1141
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:11,980
You will pick, like, there are no messages for Bob in this batch.

1142
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:15,980
Oh, let's send a message to Bob and Charlie and Edward and this.

1143
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,980
Okay?

1144
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:18,980
Well, let's send more messages than there really are.

1145
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:23,980
And they will be marked specifically so that when the destination, the actual destination

1146
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,980
receives them, they'll just throw them away.

1147
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:29,980
So that's one way to obscure.

1148
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:34,980
Does anybody know why R0 is necessary?

1149
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:41,980
If Alice sends the same message to Bob multiple times, if you don't have R0 and there's a

1150
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,980
little bit of a caveat, if the public key encryption is deterministic, then this message R0, that's

1151
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:43,980
the same.

1152
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:44,980
This message from mixed to Bob would be the same.

1153
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:45,980
No?

1154
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:46,980
No?

1155
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:47,980
No?

1156
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:48,980
No?

1157
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:49,980
No?

1158
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:50,980
No?

1159
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:51,980
No.

1160
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:52,980
No.

1161
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:53,980
No.

1162
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:54,980
No.

1163
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:55,980
No.

1164
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:56,980
No.

1165
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:57,980
No.

1166
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:58,980
No.

1167
01:11:58,980 --> 01:11:59,980
No.

1168
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:00,980
No.

1169
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:01,980
No.

1170
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:02,980
No.

1171
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:03,980
No.

1172
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:04,980
No.

1173
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:05,980
No.

1174
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:06,980
No.

1175
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:07,980
No.

1176
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:08,980
No.

1177
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:09,980
No.

1178
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:10,980
No.

1179
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:11,980
No.

1180
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:13,980
No.

1181
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:14,980
No.

1182
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:15,980
No.

1183
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:16,980
No.

1184
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:17,980
No.

1185
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:18,980
No.

1186
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:19,980
No.

1187
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:20,980
No.

1188
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:21,980
No.

1189
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:24,980
No.

1190
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,980
No.

1191
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:27,980
No.

1192
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:28,980
No.

1193
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:29,980
No.

1194
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:30,980
No, no.

1195
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:31,980
No.

1196
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:32,980
No, no, no.

1197
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,380
Like why do I have these?

1198
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,180
That's more of it.

1199
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,000
Not really necessary.

1200
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,420
Like extra randomization.

1201
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,140
But does everybody see how a mix works?

1202
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,820
Okay.

1203
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,500
All right, let's end here.

1204
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,820
See you on Thursday.
