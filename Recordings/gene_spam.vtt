00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
It's the MCM syndrome that I recommend, it's, you know, tells you everything you want to know about spam.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
And surprisingly, 20 years, not many things change about spam.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
But, so why the parallel? Well, spam is annoying, right? This spam.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
And so is the email spam or electronic spam. So that's where the analogy comes from.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
I do some stats. I didn't, like, double check them, but I think they're reasonably accurate.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
So, number of, like, email versus spam, right?

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
So you see the bars, the total bars represent total email spam.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
The red part is the percentage of spam. I'm sorry. Total email, percentage of spam.

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
From this six-year period, ending in 2022, my guess is it hasn't changed very much.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
It probably continued along the same line up to 20, 25.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
Interestingly, more spam was sent as a percentage of all emails, like, six years ago.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
And then it kind of sort of levels off, you know, right?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
But it's still impressive, right? If you haven't seen this, it is impressive.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
Email is still, right? Maybe not so much, you think, for your generation because you've never really worked outside.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Or many of you haven't really worked in real jobs.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
But once you get a real job, yes, people use Slack and, you know, some other versions thereof and wikis and God knows what else.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
But email is still there and it has no signs of going away.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
So I predict email is not going to go away for at least a decade.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
It's for the time it is here to stay.

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
So, an enlarged percentage of it is spam.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Spam is not only email-based.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
You may have received robocalls, right? That's spam.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
That's just another version of spam.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Text messages? Yes? Text?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
A lot of SMS.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Sometimes WhatsApp, right?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Well, I get WhatsApp spam.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Not a lot, but I get it.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Like, once every couple of weeks.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
SMS, I get once every couple of days.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
Some of these I don't see because it's already, like, filtered.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
Never have I ever received spam on Signal.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Anybody use Signal?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Highly recommended.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
For secure messaging.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Okay?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
If you want to be secure, do not use Telegram.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
That's slimy through and through.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Okay?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Do not.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Unless you want the FBI to knock on your door.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
No, seriously.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Do not use Telegram.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
SMS.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Just assume everybody reads it.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Okay?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Just assume that it's not private.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
WhatsApp?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Eh...

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Meta.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Do you trust Mark?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Exactly.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Have you looked at him?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I don't trust Mark.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Signal.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Public domain.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Okay.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
So, you can look at the code.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Eh...

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
I trust Signal more than others.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Not that I trust it, but I trust that I did more than others.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
So, if I had to, like, send something securely today, I would do Signal, I might actually split

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
the message in two parts and send something by a signal and something by WhatsApp.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Are you getting what I'm saying?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Right?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
But I message is distinct, right?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Right?

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
I message is distinct, but I message is like a stupid overlay.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Right?

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
So, I message works for Macs and iPhones.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
What about the rest of it?

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
It's a stupid walled garden religion that Apple imposed on us.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Right?

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
So, yes, iMessage, if you live entirely within Apple universe, iMessage is okay.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
But the problem is, many of us, maybe not you all, but many of us people who use Apple

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
products communicate with non-Apple users.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
And you don't often pay attention or know that your text message isn't an iMessage, but

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
goes out of the Apple universe.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
And the moment it goes out of the Apple universe, it no longer has that security.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
So, and then, so text messages and messaging apps, you know, have a lot that can present.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Phone calls, yeah?

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
If your phone number is somewhere, chances are, you know, you will get text spam.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
I'm sorry, phone spam by robocalls, sometimes by live people, but that's, that's like not

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
really spam.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I mean, it's annoying.

04:58.000 --> 05:07.000
And then email is, uh, the lion's share of, of spam is 50% or so.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
So, this is a disturbing thing.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
So this is, a graph is kind of hard to read.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Uh, so look at the red part.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
It just claims, again, I didn't double verify it.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
It seems reasonably credible.

05:23.000 --> 05:32.000
Number of people who lost money due to like scams, spam based scams.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
So we're talking here from under 20 million in 2014, all the way to what?

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
close to 60 million in 2024.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Now, I believe that this is cumulative.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
So it's not like 2024, 60 million lost.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
It's all these other accumulated stuff that, by 2024, 60 million lost money.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
I think that it's not, I don't believe this is a discreet per year.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Although there's a dip here, but I don't, I don't.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
There's a dip here, but I don't believe it.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
They recovered their money.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Some probably did.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I would say very small percentage.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Very small.

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
What looks more is, uh, credible is, uh, the yellow part of the graph that shows the average,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
uh, money per person lost.

06:21.000 --> 06:28.000
You know, and these, uh, when it, when this talks about, uh, scam calls, it talks about also

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
email, right?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
So it includes email.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
So things like, oh, you know, we, here's a bill for, I don't know, Norton defender.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Or here's a thank you for your purchase of Adobe creative cloud.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Right.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
You've seen those emails, right?

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
They say, and here's the bill, or we charged your card or something like that.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Right.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
And you call the number.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
Somebody does, maybe a relative or a friend, and, uh, they give up their password because

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
they're tricked.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
They lose the money.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Typically these types of scams do not result in like emptying of bank accounts because banks

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
often have some safeguards in place, but, uh, people do lose money and no longer.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
Uh, subjects.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
What kind of subjects?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Well, it's no longer like Nigerian princes, right?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Right.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Or Malaysian, uh, multi-billionaires, right?

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Who want to share their immense wealth, uh, with you.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Right.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Only if you provide a small amount of information on your bank account where they need to transfer.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Uh, but you've got prizes and giveaway job opportunities and banking, right?

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
The banking spams are typically the ones you've seen where, uh, we identify the problem with

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
your account.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Please immediately call this number.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
Or please click on this link to confirm, uh, your data, right?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Or change your password.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Okay.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Um, and this goes, actually, that's a separate category.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Request to change your password after your account.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Then software download, right?

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
I mean, uh, you have, we have a new release of, uh, an XYZ package.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Uh, we see you're using it and enjoying it.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
Please download the free, uh, the next beautiful version of that package.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Oh, my gambling.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Haven't seen that much.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I'm surprised it's 20%.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Adult content.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
That used to be a lot more, a lot more.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
Like 10 years ago, I would say half of the spam was porn or porn related.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Now it's, it's down.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
There's probably a good, like social science explanation.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Cryptocurrency scams.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Are they out there?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Not a huge amount, but they're out there.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
I see, I see spam.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
I see spam with cryptocurrency.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
Uh, especially, these are especially on WhatsApp and text.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Not so much by email.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And then all kinds of stuff.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Pharmaceuticals also used to be a huge thing, right?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Huge.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Uh, like 15 years ago.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Pharmaceuticals scams.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
The usual.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
Viagra, Cialis, boldness cures, weight loss.

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
Between those three, like lose weight fast, performance, sexual performance enhancements,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
and hair.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Sometimes it was loose hair.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Usually it was like regrow hair fast, right?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
So these three dominated.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Now they're very small.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I'm surprised.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
And then, uh, okay.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Romance scams.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
That's more like, that's a niche.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
That's not in this country so much.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
That's, that's outside.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
And now let's not confuse the dating app scams, right?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
That's a whole different.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I'm not, I'm ruling those out here.

09:40.000 --> 09:57.000
You know, these dating apps where they have bots and, uh, uh, that's a whole different

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Okay.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
Uh, here's some more numbers for you.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
About 160 billion spam emails are sending it.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Billion!

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Billion, right?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
This price.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
We have what?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
4 billion people?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
5 billion people on this earth?

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
There's not many emails are sent every freaking day.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
Um, and that's good part of the 350 billion emails overall set.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
Uh, most people receive spam messages.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
The problem is what, so how does spam work?

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
Uh, how, how do spammers harvest email addresses?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Well, the most obvious like they crawl, right?

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
They crawl the web and they look for email addresses.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
And all these tricks that people used to do and still do with like, uh, you know, not

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
using the add sign, but say add or something, right?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Or, oh, it's my name at blah, blah, blah.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Those don't work because these, these crawlers can convert us into email address.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Sometimes the email address is a guest.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
Like smith at yahoo.com is going to be an email address, right?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Joey at yahoo.com.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Uh, you know, uh, Gene Sudik at gmail.com.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Well, you need to know my last name, right?

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
But, but you know, more predictable last names and first names, any combinations that are

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
going to be existing email.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
No, it doesn't take a rocket scientist.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Most of the spam of actual people who send spam don't do the crawling.

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
Crawling is done by whole other people system that then sells this harvested spam addresses

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
to the spam, right?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
To the actual spam.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Also, they filter them.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
So when they collect them, they actually test that they exist.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Right?

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
So you get this, what's called data clean in the database world.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
So they clean the data and then they sell the giant, uh, collections of databases of existing,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
uh, email addresses to those who actually want to send spam.

11:57.000 --> 12:05.000
Uh, maybe it will surprise you that the US sends the most spam.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
There is most spam originates inside the US.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
It may have actually been crafted somewhere else, but the, the sender from the email point

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
of view is here in the United States.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Followed by China.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Uh, let's see.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Okay.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
The rest of them are important.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
Uh, financial.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Now, now this is some, because I was hoping we would have a lecture on phishing.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
I'm not sure if we, at the speed we're going to have that.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Phishing and spam are like fraternal twins.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Okay.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Now, spam can be without phishing.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
And if I draw a Venn diagram, there will be a giant overlap.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
You know, everybody knows a Venn diagram, right?

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Between spam and phishing, but they have distinct parts.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
So, spam is a vehicle for phishing.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Often.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Not always.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
Spam can be also selling, I don't know, pharmaceuticals, right?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Is that phishing?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
No.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
A lot of that stuff is like you want to buy, uh, Adderall.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Maybe because it's without prescription.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
It may be illegal for you to do so.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
But if you go to the website and enter your credit card, they won't steal it.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
They will ship you Adderall, maybe.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
Or if you want to, uh, I don't know, buy something else, right?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I mean, uh, a walk, what is it?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
The typical one?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
A walk-in bathtub.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Everybody knows what that is?

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
For some reason, there was a favorite subject of spam for a while.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
That's for old people or people who are handicapped.

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
A walk-in bathtub is a bathtub that has a door that you don't have to, like, step in.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Yes?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
You've seen those?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Ever?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
No?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Ever seen spam on that?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Very popular stuff for a long time.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
So, surely there is a walk-in bathtub you can buy, probably overpriced.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Okay?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
So it's not phishing.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
It's just selling crap.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
It's the same idea that you get in the mailbox, right?

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
You get these useless things, if you ever check, like, actual mail, physical mail.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
You get these useless advertisements, right, for stuff that you don't need most of the time.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
A sail in some, you know, Nordstrom's rack or whatever.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
That's physical spam.

14:34.000 --> 14:42.000
And, you know, a walk-in bathtub or, I don't know, cheap solar batteries installed in three minutes.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
That's also that kind of spam.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
It's not phishing.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
Phishing is what they want to extract something from you that is, like, very personal.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Like, credentials.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Right?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Okay.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Oh, yeah.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Delivery services.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
We have a package for you, right?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
This is typical via text, right?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Typically SMS, right?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Because a lot of the delivery services, FedEx, DHL, right?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Amazon, right?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
They use SMS.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Many do.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
And so you get this unsolicited text from some special, like a four-six-digit number, right?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
That's not really typically a real phone number.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
And it says, we have a delivery.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
It's waiting for you.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
We just need you to confirm your credit card.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Details.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Maybe you won't find that surprising.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.680
Men 65 and over received the most spam calls.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.680
No.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.680
No.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.680
Not.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.680
No.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.680
No.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.680
No.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.680
No.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.680
No, no.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.680
No.

15:33.680 --> 15:34.680
No, I'm not.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.680
All right, I'm sorry.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.680
Very.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.680
Holy shit.

15:38.680 --> 15:39.680
Oh.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.680
No.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.680
No.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.680
No, no.

15:42.680 --> 15:50.760
and men 18 to 34 the less the least

15:50.760 --> 15:57.500
any explanation when you might think that's so

15:57.500 --> 16:05.780
what happens at 65? usual retirement right?

16:05.780 --> 16:11.160
yes but retirement right? so you have

16:11.160 --> 16:14.400
idleness right? so you're a working man

16:14.400 --> 16:18.160
you're a working person you don't have time to talk to spammers

16:18.160 --> 16:22.080
right? or follow up on some email

16:22.080 --> 16:25.240
you just ignore whatever you're retired

16:25.240 --> 16:27.080
now all of a sudden you have a lot of time on your head

16:27.080 --> 16:31.040
you're bored and you have money

16:31.040 --> 16:35.720
yeah? you have money you save money you work all your life or whatever

16:35.720 --> 16:41.720
65 not that long maybe but so these are the most ripe

16:41.720 --> 16:44.780
the most ripe soil for spammers

16:44.780 --> 16:49.360
people with disposable income who are idle and bored

16:49.360 --> 16:55.960
these people I mean crypto millionaires aside

16:55.960 --> 16:59.360
right? these people have no money

16:59.360 --> 17:02.360
and they have the attention span of a food flight

17:02.360 --> 17:08.360
right? not a good target for spammers

17:08.360 --> 17:11.420
these people also remember these are like boomers

17:11.420 --> 17:14.420
here 65 and over are boomers

17:14.420 --> 17:17.360
different generation more perhaps more trusting

17:17.360 --> 17:20.360
a little more serious you know

17:20.360 --> 17:26.360
these people roughly your age

17:26.360 --> 17:29.420
I mean these are men mind you but I think women get fewer

17:29.420 --> 17:33.420
but I don't know how to explain that

17:33.420 --> 17:35.360
list not obvious questions

17:35.360 --> 17:37.360
alright let's switch into something a little more technical

17:37.360 --> 17:45.360
so email have you ever wondered what your email does when it leaves your hands when you click send?

17:45.360 --> 17:52.420
was that covered in any networking courses? yes?

17:52.420 --> 17:54.420
not here

17:54.420 --> 17:55.420
thank you

17:55.420 --> 17:57.420
not here

17:57.420 --> 17:58.420
where?

17:58.420 --> 17:59.420
I want to go there

17:59.420 --> 18:05.420
yes I suppose it wasn't covered in networking courses here unfortunately

18:05.420 --> 18:07.420
which it should be

18:07.420 --> 18:09.420
so you are the sender

18:09.420 --> 18:11.420
you have your

18:11.420 --> 18:15.480
are you all like browser email users?

18:15.480 --> 18:18.480
who is a non-browser email user?

18:18.480 --> 18:21.480
anybody use an email front-end?

18:21.480 --> 18:23.480
like an email program?

18:23.480 --> 18:24.420
no

18:24.420 --> 18:25.420
wow

18:25.420 --> 18:27.480
sign of the times

18:27.480 --> 18:28.540
okay

18:28.540 --> 18:32.540
it's a little different in your case

18:32.540 --> 18:33.540
because

18:33.540 --> 18:37.540
you are essentially using a front-end

18:37.540 --> 18:39.540
kind of a fake front-end

18:39.540 --> 18:41.540
your client browser

18:41.540 --> 18:43.540
to access your gmail

18:43.540 --> 18:44.540
right?

18:44.540 --> 18:46.540
anybody here non-gmail?

18:46.540 --> 18:52.540
you seem almost hesitant

18:52.540 --> 18:55.540
look at this monoculture

18:55.540 --> 18:57.600
you are all gmail users

18:57.600 --> 19:00.600
is that because UCI dictates it?

19:00.600 --> 19:03.600
do you have any other non-gmail accounts?

19:03.600 --> 19:04.600
yeah

19:04.600 --> 19:05.600
yeah

19:05.600 --> 19:06.600
okay

19:06.600 --> 19:10.600
but you use the browser as well to access those

19:10.600 --> 19:12.600
interesting

19:12.600 --> 19:15.600
well I don't think the browser on mobile devices

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
no

19:16.600 --> 19:23.600
on the mobile devices I guess you use your mail app right?

19:23.600 --> 19:25.660
well that's essentially the same thing right?

19:25.660 --> 19:27.660
everybody uses like an API phone

19:27.660 --> 19:28.660
well no

19:28.660 --> 19:29.660
that's a different thing

19:29.660 --> 19:30.660
okay

19:30.660 --> 19:31.660
so let's think about your mail app

19:31.660 --> 19:32.660
like

19:32.660 --> 19:35.660
do people use mail on phones?

19:35.660 --> 19:37.660
do you all use mail on phones?

19:37.660 --> 19:38.660
like that?

19:38.660 --> 19:39.660
okay

19:39.660 --> 19:40.660
so you have an app

19:40.660 --> 19:41.660
right?

19:41.660 --> 19:42.660
good

19:42.660 --> 19:43.660
so now we can connect better

19:43.660 --> 19:45.660
you click send

19:45.660 --> 19:46.660
your app is that

19:46.660 --> 19:47.660
is that box over here

19:47.660 --> 19:48.660
right?

19:48.660 --> 19:49.660
that's your app over there

19:49.660 --> 19:50.660
in that box

19:50.660 --> 19:53.720
it's a computer but it's really like in this case be your phone

19:53.720 --> 19:54.720
and so it's a client

19:54.720 --> 19:56.720
it's an email client

19:56.720 --> 19:57.720
and

19:57.720 --> 19:59.720
when you configured it

19:59.720 --> 20:01.720
you had to put some stuff in there

20:01.720 --> 20:03.720
do you remember?

20:03.720 --> 20:06.720
like you have to say what is your outgoing server?

20:06.720 --> 20:08.720
Nicole doing that?

20:08.720 --> 20:09.720
no Nicole

20:09.720 --> 20:11.720
oh they give you a profile?

20:11.720 --> 20:13.720
it's just one of your most login

20:13.720 --> 20:18.780
oh my god

20:18.780 --> 20:19.780
oh my god

20:19.780 --> 20:20.780
okay

20:20.780 --> 20:21.780
so

20:21.780 --> 20:23.780
with google

20:23.780 --> 20:24.780
even if you are using gmail

20:24.780 --> 20:25.780
with a client

20:25.780 --> 20:26.780
it goes to

20:26.780 --> 20:27.780
something called

20:27.780 --> 20:29.780
smtp.something.something

20:29.780 --> 20:30.780
which in this case

20:30.780 --> 20:33.780
will be smtp.google.gmail

20:33.780 --> 20:34.780
blah blah blah

20:34.780 --> 20:36.780
and that's your relay

20:36.780 --> 20:38.780
relay

20:38.780 --> 20:46.840
now if your destination is in google world

20:46.840 --> 20:51.840
that same mail relay is going to deliver it to the recipient

20:51.840 --> 20:53.840
so you won't have this stage

20:53.840 --> 20:55.840
this mail relay

20:55.840 --> 20:56.840
if it's google

20:56.840 --> 20:58.840
and your destination if you have it is google

20:58.840 --> 21:02.840
it will just hand over to the recipient

21:02.840 --> 21:04.840
actually it won't handle it

21:04.840 --> 21:06.840
technically it just stores it

21:06.840 --> 21:12.900
that some people either pop or imap server

21:12.900 --> 21:14.900
but that's not interesting

21:14.900 --> 21:16.900
but generally if you send email to some

21:16.900 --> 21:18.900
let's say you have a friend in

21:18.900 --> 21:21.900
I don't know American Samoa

21:21.900 --> 21:24.900
and you send an email and they have an address with like

21:24.900 --> 21:26.900
ending with S

21:26.900 --> 21:30.900
I guess it would be ASA or something like that

21:30.900 --> 21:35.900
it will be given to the mail relay

21:35.900 --> 21:39.900
which is the outgoing server

21:39.900 --> 21:41.900
and that server will figure out

21:41.900 --> 21:45.900
what is the recipient's mail relay

21:45.900 --> 21:47.900
okay

21:47.900 --> 21:50.900
and it will hand over over the internet

21:50.900 --> 21:53.900
generally this can actually be over the internet

21:53.900 --> 21:55.900
and it will hand over the mail

21:55.900 --> 21:59.900
and then it will get to the recipient

21:59.900 --> 22:01.900
but that's a funny detail here

22:01.900 --> 22:03.900
the recipient may have a separate server

22:03.900 --> 22:05.900
where the mail is stored

22:05.900 --> 22:09.900
that's usually what's called POP3 or IMAP

22:09.900 --> 22:11.900
depending on how you configure it

22:11.900 --> 22:13.900
mailbox

22:13.900 --> 22:14.900
okay

22:14.900 --> 22:17.900
so you actually fetch email from there

22:17.900 --> 22:19.900
when you refresh

22:19.900 --> 22:21.900
all right

22:21.900 --> 22:24.900
but the important thing is to understand

22:24.900 --> 22:26.900
is that this is not real time communication

22:26.900 --> 22:29.900
remember I kept saying that email is stored forward

22:29.900 --> 22:31.900
so like

22:31.900 --> 22:33.900
if for example

22:33.900 --> 22:35.900
this mail relay is down

22:35.900 --> 22:39.900
this one will buffer your mail

22:39.900 --> 22:43.900
you might even try a different mail relay

22:43.900 --> 22:49.900
so that means it's kind of tolerant of delays

22:49.900 --> 22:51.900
and failures

22:51.900 --> 22:53.900
TCP is not right

22:53.900 --> 22:55.900
so this is

22:55.900 --> 22:57.900
if this was end to end TCP

22:57.900 --> 22:59.900
it wouldn't work

22:59.900 --> 23:01.900
but with mail relays because they are running

23:01.900 --> 23:03.900
application layer right

23:03.900 --> 23:05.900
yeah

23:05.900 --> 23:07.900
setting up your own mail relay

23:07.900 --> 23:09.900
you could in principle do that

23:09.900 --> 23:11.900
you would have to get your own domain

23:11.900 --> 23:13.900
probably for that

23:13.900 --> 23:15.900
you can get a domain

23:15.900 --> 23:17.900
you can buy one

23:17.900 --> 23:19.900
you can set up your own mail relay

23:19.900 --> 23:21.900
you can right now

23:21.900 --> 23:23.900
let's say you are

23:23.900 --> 23:25.900
you live in Irvine here

23:25.900 --> 23:27.900
you are sort of stuck with COX

23:27.900 --> 23:29.900
internet

23:29.900 --> 23:31.900
you cannot set up your own mail relay

23:31.900 --> 23:33.900
at least not easily

23:33.900 --> 23:35.900
right

23:35.900 --> 23:37.900
but if you buy your own domain

23:37.900 --> 23:39.900
then you can

23:39.900 --> 23:41.900
well I was saying

23:41.900 --> 23:43.900
so if you set it up right

23:43.900 --> 23:45.900
and then you are up to your own Gmail

23:45.900 --> 23:47.900
and you are trying to send

23:47.900 --> 23:49.900
if you set up your own mail relay

23:49.900 --> 23:51.900
then it's a front end

23:51.900 --> 23:53.900
so when you send mail

23:53.900 --> 23:55.900
you would go for that relay

23:55.900 --> 23:57.900
and then to Gmail

23:57.900 --> 23:59.900
but if you are using the browser

23:59.900 --> 24:01.900
it will still go directly to Google

24:01.900 --> 24:03.900
your mail

24:03.900 --> 24:05.900
your mail really will be irrelevant

24:05.900 --> 24:07.900
you see because when you are using a browser

24:07.900 --> 24:09.900
you are not using

24:09.900 --> 24:11.900
you are not using the actual email

24:11.900 --> 24:13.900
you are using like an interface

24:13.900 --> 24:15.900
through the email

24:15.900 --> 24:17.900
so it's like a storage forward component

24:17.900 --> 24:19.900
can you like do a denial of service attack on the storage forward

24:19.900 --> 24:21.900
like I assume there is only a limited amount of memory

24:21.900 --> 24:25.900
generally mail relays have a lot of disk space

24:25.900 --> 24:27.900
they don't keep those things in memory

24:27.900 --> 24:29.900
they only keep them when they

24:29.900 --> 24:31.900
if they try to send

24:31.900 --> 24:32.900
if they cannot send

24:32.900 --> 24:33.900
if the send does not succeed

24:33.900 --> 24:35.900
they buffer on this

24:35.900 --> 24:37.900
but you could presumably do like a malicious attack

24:37.900 --> 24:39.900
you could make

24:39.900 --> 24:41.900
but that will still

24:41.900 --> 24:43.900
there is a limited amount of time

24:43.900 --> 24:44.900
that it will try to retransmit

24:44.900 --> 24:45.900
then it will delete

24:45.900 --> 24:47.900
you will see mail undeliverable

24:47.900 --> 24:49.900
how many of you have seen this?

24:49.900 --> 24:51.900
undeliverable mail

24:51.900 --> 24:52.900
that's an error message saying

24:52.900 --> 24:53.900
he tried

24:53.900 --> 24:54.900
he tried

24:54.900 --> 24:55.900
and then he gave up

24:55.900 --> 24:56.900
so

24:56.900 --> 24:58.900
ok

24:58.900 --> 24:59.900
ok

24:59.900 --> 25:00.900
so

25:00.900 --> 25:01.900
mail relay

25:01.900 --> 25:02.900
forwards mail

25:02.900 --> 25:03.900
to the next

25:03.900 --> 25:04.900
hop

25:04.900 --> 25:05.900
in principle

25:05.900 --> 25:06.900
there could be more

25:06.900 --> 25:07.900
most of the time

25:07.900 --> 25:08.900
most of the time

25:08.900 --> 25:09.900
today

25:09.900 --> 25:10.900
you will have

25:10.900 --> 25:11.900
at most

25:11.900 --> 25:13.900
two mail relays

25:13.900 --> 25:15.900
meaning you will have something like this

25:15.900 --> 25:18.900
if you are sending mail

25:18.900 --> 25:19.900
from

25:19.900 --> 25:20.900
a domain

25:20.900 --> 25:22.900
to a destination

25:22.900 --> 25:23.900
in the same domain

25:23.900 --> 25:24.900
you only have one relay

25:24.900 --> 25:26.900
because that one relay relay

25:26.900 --> 25:27.900
will deliver it right away

25:27.900 --> 25:28.900
to the destination

25:28.900 --> 25:29.900
does that make sense?

25:36.900 --> 25:37.900
so

25:37.900 --> 25:40.900
the way that email works

25:40.900 --> 25:41.900
is governed by

25:41.900 --> 25:43.900
a protocol called SMTP

25:43.900 --> 25:46.900
simple mail transfer protocol

25:46.900 --> 25:49.900
not extremely simple

25:49.900 --> 25:50.900
but not too complicated

25:50.900 --> 25:51.900
ok

25:51.900 --> 25:52.900
not like TCP

25:52.900 --> 25:54.900
but it is a protocol

25:54.900 --> 25:55.900
not a packet form

25:55.900 --> 25:56.900
right

25:56.900 --> 25:57.900
so

25:57.900 --> 25:58.900
here you have

25:58.900 --> 25:59.900
Bob

25:59.900 --> 26:00.900
and Bob is

26:00.900 --> 26:01.900
like

26:01.900 --> 26:02.900
think of Bob as like

26:02.900 --> 26:03.900
somebody writing an app

26:03.900 --> 26:04.900
on their iphone

26:04.900 --> 26:05.900
a mail app

26:05.900 --> 26:06.900
or

26:06.900 --> 26:07.900
like me

26:07.900 --> 26:08.900
kind of Neanderthal

26:08.900 --> 26:09.900
who has an email fronted

26:09.900 --> 26:10.900
I run Thunderbird

26:10.900 --> 26:11.900
so my email

26:11.900 --> 26:13.900
is

26:13.900 --> 26:14.900
is done by

26:14.900 --> 26:15.900
Thunderbird

26:15.900 --> 26:16.900
program

26:16.900 --> 26:17.900
on my

26:17.900 --> 26:18.900
laptop

26:18.900 --> 26:19.900
so

26:19.900 --> 26:20.900
I'm that guy

26:20.900 --> 26:21.900
and

26:21.900 --> 26:22.900
when I click send

26:22.900 --> 26:24.900
SMTP

26:24.900 --> 26:25.900
governs

26:25.900 --> 26:26.900
how my

26:26.900 --> 26:27.900
message

26:27.900 --> 26:28.900
is transferred

26:28.900 --> 26:29.900
to

26:29.900 --> 26:30.900
my

26:30.900 --> 26:31.900
nearest

26:31.900 --> 26:32.900
outgoing

26:32.900 --> 26:33.900
server

26:33.900 --> 26:34.900
that is configured

26:34.900 --> 26:35.900
in my profile

26:35.900 --> 26:36.900
it is configured

26:36.900 --> 26:37.900
in your profile

26:37.900 --> 26:39.900
if you look into your mail app

26:39.900 --> 26:40.900
on your iphone

26:40.900 --> 26:41.900
or android

26:41.900 --> 26:42.900
ok

26:42.900 --> 26:44.900
you can actually see

26:44.900 --> 26:45.900
what is the

26:45.900 --> 26:46.900
address

26:46.900 --> 26:47.900
the host name

26:47.900 --> 26:48.900
of your outgoing

26:48.900 --> 26:49.900
relay

26:49.900 --> 26:50.900
this guy

26:50.900 --> 26:51.900
this guy

26:51.900 --> 26:52.900
here

26:52.900 --> 26:53.900
it's

26:53.900 --> 26:54.900
it's there

26:54.900 --> 26:55.900
and then

26:55.900 --> 26:58.900
so if the email goes to some organization

26:58.900 --> 26:59.900
where Alice works

26:59.900 --> 27:01.900
well that organization has its own

27:01.900 --> 27:03.900
server or relay

27:03.900 --> 27:05.900
and that

27:05.900 --> 27:06.900
transfer

27:06.900 --> 27:07.900
between

27:07.900 --> 27:08.900
relays

27:08.900 --> 27:09.900
or between servers

27:09.900 --> 27:10.900
I use server and relay

27:10.900 --> 27:11.900
interchangeably

27:11.900 --> 27:13.900
is also governed by SMTP

27:13.900 --> 27:14.900
ok

27:14.900 --> 27:15.900
but it's

27:15.900 --> 27:16.900
hop

27:16.900 --> 27:17.900
by

27:17.900 --> 27:18.900
hop

27:18.900 --> 27:19.900
not end to end

27:19.900 --> 27:20.900
hop

27:20.900 --> 27:21.900
by hop

27:21.900 --> 27:22.900
and then here

27:22.900 --> 27:23.900
between

27:23.900 --> 27:25.900
Alice's mail server

27:25.900 --> 27:26.900
and actual recipient

27:26.900 --> 27:28.900
there's something called

27:28.900 --> 27:29.900
there's several

27:29.900 --> 27:30.900
protocols for fetching

27:30.900 --> 27:33.900
actually fetching email

27:33.900 --> 27:34.900
because

27:34.900 --> 27:35.900
what email does

27:35.900 --> 27:36.900
is SMTP

27:36.900 --> 27:37.900
delivers it

27:37.900 --> 27:38.900
to the last pop

27:38.900 --> 27:40.900
but not to the client

27:40.900 --> 27:41.900
not to the recipient

27:41.900 --> 27:43.900
the recipient has to explicitly fetch

27:43.900 --> 27:45.900
mail

27:45.900 --> 27:47.900
and that's done by

27:47.900 --> 27:48.900
several protocols

27:48.900 --> 27:49.900
one

27:49.900 --> 27:50.900
you know

27:50.900 --> 27:51.900
pop three is one

27:51.900 --> 27:52.900
and IMAP

27:52.900 --> 27:53.900
is another

27:53.900 --> 27:54.900
and there might be others

27:54.900 --> 27:55.900
as well

27:55.900 --> 27:56.900
but these are the two

27:56.900 --> 27:57.900
the two most popular

27:57.900 --> 27:58.900
pop

27:58.900 --> 27:59.900
post office protocol

27:59.900 --> 28:02.900
and IMAP

28:02.900 --> 28:03.900
stands for

28:03.900 --> 28:04.900
internet mail

28:04.900 --> 28:05.900
and something

28:05.900 --> 28:07.900
agent protocol

28:07.900 --> 28:08.900
or something like that

28:08.900 --> 28:10.900
but we won't be talking about those

28:10.900 --> 28:11.900
those are not very interesting

28:11.900 --> 28:13.900
the most interesting part is

28:13.900 --> 28:14.900
this

28:14.900 --> 28:15.900
this

28:18.900 --> 28:19.900
there are two

28:19.900 --> 28:20.900
ports

28:20.900 --> 28:21.900
and I'm gonna tell you a bit about SMTP

28:21.900 --> 28:22.900
because I figured you never heard

28:22.900 --> 28:23.900
how it works

28:23.900 --> 28:24.900
alright

28:24.900 --> 28:25.900
it actually

28:25.900 --> 28:26.900
it's a little confusing

28:26.900 --> 28:27.900
because it works

28:27.900 --> 28:29.900
it works with two different ports

28:29.900 --> 28:31.900
remember port socket

28:31.900 --> 28:34.900
port

28:34.900 --> 28:35.900
port 25

28:35.900 --> 28:37.900
is a standard email port

28:37.900 --> 28:40.900
it's been around since 1982

28:40.900 --> 28:41.900
and

28:41.900 --> 28:42.900
right around

28:42.900 --> 28:45.900
very soon after IP and TCP were first proposed

28:45.900 --> 28:50.900
it is beloved by spammers

28:50.900 --> 28:52.900
because it is insecure

28:52.900 --> 28:55.900
so the port 25

28:55.900 --> 28:58.900
is essentially supporting what's called open relay

28:58.900 --> 29:00.900
which I'll tell you about in a minute

29:00.900 --> 29:03.900
it is supported by

29:03.900 --> 29:05.900
it shouldn't be used

29:05.900 --> 29:08.900
by your email front end

29:08.900 --> 29:10.900
so your app for example

29:10.900 --> 29:12.900
if you look at your email app

29:12.900 --> 29:15.900
and the configuration of your email app

29:15.900 --> 29:18.900
one of the things it will tell you there

29:18.900 --> 29:20.900
is what protocol to use

29:20.900 --> 29:22.900
maybe you have

29:22.900 --> 29:23.900
you've tried to add an email account

29:23.900 --> 29:24.900
to your email app

29:24.900 --> 29:25.900
has anybody done this?

29:25.900 --> 29:27.900
add an account

29:27.900 --> 29:29.900
does it ask you a set of questions?

29:29.900 --> 29:30.900
mine does

29:30.900 --> 29:33.900
but that's because mine isn't set up in the standard way

29:33.900 --> 29:35.900
but in my experience

29:35.900 --> 29:37.900
all of them ask you questions

29:37.900 --> 29:38.900
yeah

29:38.900 --> 29:39.900
like you say

29:39.900 --> 29:40.900
what is your username

29:40.900 --> 29:41.900
right

29:41.900 --> 29:42.900
what is your email provider

29:42.900 --> 29:43.900
right

29:43.900 --> 29:44.900
what is your username

29:44.900 --> 29:45.900
it asks you password

29:45.900 --> 29:46.900
right

29:46.900 --> 29:48.900
then it asks you also like

29:48.900 --> 29:50.900
what protocol

29:50.900 --> 29:52.900
and that will give you choices

29:52.900 --> 29:53.900
ok

29:53.900 --> 29:54.900
so

29:54.900 --> 29:56.900
25 is one choice

29:56.900 --> 29:58.900
it might not be supported

29:58.900 --> 29:59.900
and for good reason

29:59.900 --> 30:01.900
because it's not secure

30:01.900 --> 30:03.900
ISPs

30:03.900 --> 30:04.900
right

30:04.900 --> 30:06.900
the cloud hosting provider will often block it

30:06.900 --> 30:08.900
what is it actually used for?

30:08.900 --> 30:10.900
it is used for

30:10.900 --> 30:14.900
this

30:14.900 --> 30:18.900
relay to relay

30:18.900 --> 30:20.900
server to server

30:22.900 --> 30:23.900
originally

30:23.900 --> 30:25.900
everybody used port 25

30:25.900 --> 30:27.900
for like several decades

30:27.900 --> 30:29.900
and then when spam became a problem

30:29.900 --> 30:31.900
they introduced port 587

30:31.900 --> 30:33.900
and that's the one you're more likely to see

30:33.900 --> 30:35.900
587

30:35.900 --> 30:37.900
when you configure your email

30:37.900 --> 30:38.900
you know

30:38.900 --> 30:39.900
even if it's done automatically

30:39.900 --> 30:40.900
you can see it

30:40.900 --> 30:41.900
in the configuration

30:41.900 --> 30:42.900
okay

30:42.900 --> 30:44.900
there's an internet rc

30:44.900 --> 30:45.900
that's discussed

30:45.900 --> 30:46.900
it has

30:46.900 --> 30:47.900
what's called

30:47.900 --> 30:48.900
a start

30:48.900 --> 30:50.900
TLS option

30:50.900 --> 30:52.900
it's not

30:52.900 --> 30:53.900
it's an option

30:53.900 --> 30:54.900
it's not a requirement

30:54.900 --> 30:56.900
but when you use that option

30:56.900 --> 30:57.900
your email

30:57.900 --> 30:58.900
is transferred

30:58.900 --> 30:59.900
over a

30:59.900 --> 31:00.900
TLS connection

31:00.900 --> 31:03.900
and that is primarily

31:03.900 --> 31:05.900
for this

31:05.900 --> 31:08.900
from your app

31:08.900 --> 31:10.900
to the outgoing server

31:10.900 --> 31:11.900
or from your front end

31:11.900 --> 31:12.900
of your laptop

31:12.900 --> 31:13.900
to the outgoing server

31:13.900 --> 31:14.900
okay

31:14.900 --> 31:17.900
it's a little bit confusing

31:17.900 --> 31:18.900
but that's how it works

31:18.900 --> 31:20.900
so

31:20.900 --> 31:23.900
there are a lot of

31:23.900 --> 31:24.900
what's called open relays

31:24.900 --> 31:25.900
out there

31:25.900 --> 31:26.900
meaning relays

31:26.900 --> 31:27.900
that do not require you

31:27.900 --> 31:28.900
to have an account

31:28.900 --> 31:29.900
to establish a secure connection

31:29.900 --> 31:31.900
they exist for various reasons

31:31.900 --> 31:35.900
sometimes they exist because

31:35.900 --> 31:36.900
you know

31:36.900 --> 31:38.900
operators of those relays

31:38.900 --> 31:39.900
get money

31:39.900 --> 31:40.900
from spammers

31:40.900 --> 31:41.900
and other businesses

31:41.900 --> 31:43.900
sometimes they exist because

31:43.900 --> 31:44.900
people who configure them

31:44.900 --> 31:46.900
and set them up

31:46.900 --> 31:47.900
believe in

31:47.900 --> 31:49.900
freedom of speech

31:49.900 --> 31:51.900
they just don't allow

31:51.900 --> 31:53.900
anybody to send email

31:53.900 --> 31:54.900
through them

31:54.900 --> 31:55.900
okay

31:55.900 --> 31:56.900
now

31:56.900 --> 31:58.900
what does an open relay do

31:58.900 --> 32:00.900
or what does a relay in general do

32:00.900 --> 32:02.900
it is

32:02.900 --> 32:03.900
processing

32:03.900 --> 32:04.900
so it receives an email

32:04.900 --> 32:05.900
from the previous

32:05.900 --> 32:06.900
haha

32:06.900 --> 32:08.900
it looks at the header

32:08.900 --> 32:11.900
and it looks to where does it need to go

32:11.900 --> 32:12.900
right

32:12.900 --> 32:13.900
what is the destination

32:13.900 --> 32:14.900
like alice

32:14.900 --> 32:17.900
abc.com.au

32:17.900 --> 32:19.900
which means

32:19.900 --> 32:21.900
the company named ABC

32:21.900 --> 32:22.900
AU is in Australia

32:22.900 --> 32:24.900
so it needs to go to Australia

32:26.900 --> 32:27.900
and so

32:27.900 --> 32:28.900
it finds out

32:28.900 --> 32:29.900
what should be the next relay

32:29.900 --> 32:30.900
topic

32:30.900 --> 32:31.900
maybe

32:31.900 --> 32:32.900
smtp.abc.com.au

32:32.900 --> 32:33.900
maybe

32:33.900 --> 32:36.900
smtp.abc.com.au

32:36.900 --> 32:39.900
let's say that's the next email

32:39.900 --> 32:42.900
it establishes a TCP connection

32:42.900 --> 32:45.900
and then via smtp transfers the message over

32:45.900 --> 32:49.900
but as it transfers the message over

32:49.900 --> 32:50.900
it adds

32:50.900 --> 32:51.900
it adds

32:51.900 --> 32:53.900
a received from

32:53.900 --> 32:54.900
a line

32:54.900 --> 32:55.900
okay

32:55.900 --> 33:00.900
into the header field

33:00.900 --> 33:05.900
and maybe if you looked at the actual raw email

33:05.900 --> 33:07.900
you might have looked at the raw email message

33:07.900 --> 33:08.900
in plain text

33:08.900 --> 33:14.900
have you seen that it has several usually several lines that say received

33:14.900 --> 33:20.900
that is essentially the path that your email took to get to you

33:20.900 --> 33:21.900
okay

33:21.900 --> 33:27.900
that tells you exactly the sequence of relays that it traversed in order to get to you

33:27.900 --> 33:33.900
and an honest relay according to the scientific protocol needs to add itself to the received

33:33.900 --> 33:34.900
right

33:34.900 --> 33:39.900
so the header grows as an email hops around the internet the header grows never shrinks

33:40.900 --> 33:43.900
so when you receive it you actually see the exact route it took

33:43.900 --> 33:47.900
not IP route not IP route but a mail route

33:47.900 --> 33:54.900
now if the relay is hacked or it's malicious it doesn't have to do this

33:54.900 --> 33:56.900
it doesn't have to abide by the protocol

33:56.900 --> 34:00.900
and that's why for example spam may be very confusing

34:00.900 --> 34:04.900
you might not exactly see the hops it took

34:04.900 --> 34:09.900
especially typical thing is that the spammer has a

34:09.900 --> 34:12.900
as the first hop a malicious relay

34:12.900 --> 34:16.900
that does not add its name or adds some incorrect name

34:16.900 --> 34:18.900
and why to confuse you

34:18.900 --> 34:23.900
so you don't know where the intel actually comes from

34:23.900 --> 34:30.900
SMTP will not surprise you

34:30.900 --> 34:33.900
does not have any built-in authentication

34:33.900 --> 34:35.900
no built-in security whatsoever

34:35.900 --> 34:36.900
okay

34:36.900 --> 34:37.900
like IP

34:37.900 --> 34:38.900
like TCP

34:38.900 --> 34:40.900
it was an internet program

34:40.900 --> 34:43.900
one of those protocols designed in a different at a different time

34:43.900 --> 34:44.900
right

34:44.900 --> 34:45.900
50 years ago

34:45.900 --> 34:47.900
when things were very very different

34:51.900 --> 34:52.900
let's see

34:52.900 --> 34:53.900
mail from

34:53.900 --> 34:54.900
right

34:54.900 --> 34:55.900
you've seen it

34:55.900 --> 34:56.900
right

34:56.900 --> 34:57.900
if you look at the raw text email

34:57.900 --> 34:59.900
mail from is supposed to be where it actually comes from

34:59.900 --> 35:00.900
right

35:00.900 --> 35:01.900
bob

35:01.900 --> 35:04.900
xyz.com.ca

35:04.900 --> 35:05.900
which would be

35:05.900 --> 35:07.900
company xyz in Canada

35:07.900 --> 35:08.900
okay

35:08.900 --> 35:09.900
but

35:09.900 --> 35:10.900
can you trust it

35:10.900 --> 35:12.900
no

35:12.900 --> 35:13.900
of course not

35:13.900 --> 35:14.900
I

35:14.900 --> 35:15.900
just

35:15.900 --> 35:16.900
it's like the sender

35:16.900 --> 35:17.900
sender can put anything you want

35:17.900 --> 35:18.900
who wants to put

35:18.900 --> 35:19.900
you know

35:19.900 --> 35:21.900
moron.trump

35:21.900 --> 35:22.900
and whitehouse.com

35:22.900 --> 35:23.900
go ahead

35:23.900 --> 35:28.900
chancellor gilman

35:28.900 --> 35:30.900
fbci.edi

35:30.900 --> 35:31.900
whatever

35:31.900 --> 35:32.900
he can do it

35:32.900 --> 35:33.900
so

35:33.900 --> 35:35.900
and then the recipient

35:35.900 --> 35:36.900
right

35:36.900 --> 35:37.900
only sees the IP address

35:37.900 --> 35:38.900
of the direct peer

35:38.900 --> 35:39.900
meaning that

35:39.900 --> 35:40.900
the last hop

35:40.900 --> 35:41.900
from which

35:41.900 --> 35:42.900
so the only thing you can trust

35:42.900 --> 35:44.900
is that of the IP address of the last hop

35:44.900 --> 35:45.900
from the email

35:45.900 --> 35:46.900
that's it

35:46.900 --> 35:47.900
of their relay

35:47.900 --> 35:52.900
so here's the language of India

35:52.900 --> 35:54.900
this is what actually happens

35:54.900 --> 35:55.900
right

35:55.900 --> 35:56.900
between

35:56.900 --> 35:57.900
a sending mail server

35:57.900 --> 35:58.900
like on a client

35:58.900 --> 36:01.900
so this is in case of your app

36:01.900 --> 36:02.900
your mail app

36:02.900 --> 36:03.900
on your app

36:03.900 --> 36:04.900
on your phone

36:04.900 --> 36:05.900
and the first

36:05.900 --> 36:07.900
mail server

36:10.900 --> 36:11.900
first it says

36:11.900 --> 36:12.900
some people

36:12.900 --> 36:13.900
hello

36:13.900 --> 36:14.900
right

36:14.900 --> 36:15.900
so this is on port 25

36:15.900 --> 36:16.900
port 25

36:16.900 --> 36:17.900
in a

36:17.900 --> 36:18.900
in a

36:18.900 --> 36:19.900
in a

36:19.900 --> 36:20.900
in a

36:20.900 --> 36:21.900
in a

36:21.900 --> 36:22.900
in a

36:22.900 --> 36:23.900
sorry

36:23.900 --> 36:24.900
let me

36:24.900 --> 36:25.900
let me take that

36:25.900 --> 36:26.900
sorry

36:26.900 --> 36:27.900
this is between two relays

36:27.900 --> 36:28.900
not between your client

36:28.900 --> 36:29.900
not between your email client

36:29.900 --> 36:30.900
on your app

36:30.900 --> 36:31.900
but rather

36:31.900 --> 36:32.900
between two relays

36:32.900 --> 36:33.900
the sending relay

36:33.900 --> 36:34.900
and the receiving relay

36:34.900 --> 36:35.900
okay

36:35.900 --> 36:36.900
so this is using

36:36.900 --> 36:37.900
port 25

36:37.900 --> 36:38.900
because that's allowed

36:38.900 --> 36:39.900
between

36:39.900 --> 36:40.900
email servers

36:40.900 --> 36:41.900
hi there i want to send you email

36:41.900 --> 36:42.900
so it says

36:42.900 --> 36:43.900
this is not after TCP connection

36:43.900 --> 36:44.900
is established

36:44.900 --> 36:45.900
i don't show it

36:45.900 --> 36:46.900
here

36:46.900 --> 36:47.900
then it says to some people

36:47.900 --> 36:48.900
hello

36:48.900 --> 36:49.900
it's not going to spell it

36:49.900 --> 36:50.900
that's how it is called

36:50.900 --> 36:51.900
uh

36:51.900 --> 36:52.900
and now the reply is

36:52.900 --> 36:53.900
okay

36:53.900 --> 36:54.900
i'm ready to receive email

36:54.900 --> 36:55.900
from you

36:55.900 --> 36:56.900
then it says

36:56.900 --> 36:57.900
uh

36:57.900 --> 36:58.900
the mail i'm about to send you

36:58.900 --> 36:59.900
is from

36:59.900 --> 37:00.900
uh

37:00.900 --> 37:01.900
uh

37:01.900 --> 37:02.900
hello

37:02.900 --> 37:05.900
dot com

37:05.900 --> 37:06.900
and uh

37:06.900 --> 37:10.900
what the receiving mail server is supposed to do is look at that address and say

37:10.900 --> 37:17.900
do i want to do i trust this address do i want to forward email that came from this address

37:17.900 --> 37:18.900
right

37:18.900 --> 37:19.900
right

37:19.900 --> 37:20.900
and generally

37:20.900 --> 37:21.900
i mean unless it

37:21.900 --> 37:46.900
so you can have a blacklist for example it can consult some spam address database or it can have its own configuration it says okay good 250 means okay here is where it's going to then the sending server says it's going to mary at sweet tooth dot com the receiving server says okay let me check that address do i know where that is

37:46.900 --> 37:48.900
what that is

37:48.900 --> 37:49.900
do i like this address

37:49.900 --> 37:50.900
is it

37:50.900 --> 37:51.900
is that a

37:51.900 --> 37:52.900
suspicious address

37:52.900 --> 37:54.900
maybe it's a non-existent address

37:54.900 --> 37:59.900
if it's fine it says yeah looks good 250 okay

37:59.900 --> 38:00.900
and then

38:00.900 --> 38:01.900
this

38:01.900 --> 38:02.900
this

38:02.900 --> 38:03.900
here

38:03.900 --> 38:04.900
is a data transfer

38:04.900 --> 38:05.900
right

38:05.900 --> 38:07.900
actually it's one line at a time

38:07.900 --> 38:08.900
text

38:08.900 --> 38:09.900
bam

38:09.900 --> 38:10.900
bam

38:10.900 --> 38:11.900
bam

38:11.900 --> 38:12.900
the last message

38:12.900 --> 38:13.900
is a dot

38:13.900 --> 38:16.900
a one line with just a period

38:16.900 --> 38:18.900
that signifies end of message

38:18.900 --> 38:19.900
i know

38:19.900 --> 38:20.900
weird

38:20.900 --> 38:21.900
so

38:21.900 --> 38:22.900
when you said

38:22.900 --> 38:25.900
if you were to insert in your mail a period

38:25.900 --> 38:28.900
like when you type when you type out in your email

38:28.900 --> 38:31.900
if you insert a period on by itself on a line

38:31.900 --> 38:32.900
it's masked

38:32.900 --> 38:39.900
so that otherwise writing would be misinterpreted as the end of email so it is masked with a slash i think or something like that

38:39.900 --> 38:40.900
so

38:40.900 --> 38:44.900
it has to be like one period on a line that says okay we're done

38:44.900 --> 38:52.900
at this point we're done then there's a quit command and then they acknowledge that this is kind of an error message but it means i acknowledge we're done

38:52.900 --> 38:53.900
yeah

38:53.900 --> 38:58.900
is there any particular reason it has to be six back and forth or is it just the first thing they thought

38:58.900 --> 38:59.900
uh

38:59.900 --> 39:00.900
uh

39:00.900 --> 39:01.900
uh

39:01.900 --> 39:02.900
good question i don't know

39:02.900 --> 39:05.900
clearly this could be done differently right

39:05.900 --> 39:08.900
but that's that's how they're that's how the purple works

39:08.900 --> 39:15.900
you mean these hello okay mail from okay but uh yeah i mean of course you could you could imagine um

39:15.900 --> 39:20.900
hello is not just okay we're talking this is the beginning of the email of SMTP

39:20.900 --> 39:26.900
right because TCP is is below it's already established but above it is SMTP protocol right

39:26.900 --> 39:36.900
so the first two exchanges are they need to be there right just to say we are i i speak SMTP you speak SMTP

39:36.900 --> 39:45.900
the second two exchanges like mail from okay recipient to okay those could be combined indeed

39:45.900 --> 39:52.900
i don't see a reason why they're separate but that's just historically how it works

39:52.900 --> 39:57.900
so it looks more complicated than it is right it's not that difficult

39:57.900 --> 40:05.900
now this is how port 557 works this is also SMTP protocol but this is between your email client on your

40:05.900 --> 40:11.900
the app on your phone or a front end on your laptop and the outgoing server that's supposed to be more secure

40:11.900 --> 40:23.900
so uh instead of hello it's hello which means extended hello why because it's more sophisticated

40:23.900 --> 40:33.900
okay mail from same as before okay bob looks okay then sending to alice yahoo.com okay check that is okay

40:33.900 --> 40:43.900
then send data all right every piece of data is line by line until you see a period period is the end

40:43.900 --> 40:52.900
quit blah blah blah right so it's very very similar except that if you wanted to secure it you could do it

40:52.900 --> 41:00.900
you could do it you could use a tls option that's called a start tls this is a version that would use start tls

41:00.900 --> 41:08.900
tcp handshake i showed you here but the beginning then there's really hello 250 means okay and then

41:08.900 --> 41:16.900
then the receiving email server adds an option count saying start tls it means i support tls

41:16.900 --> 41:26.900
tls the email client acknowledges 2.8 means go ahead and then there's a tls negotiation there's actually a tls session

41:26.900 --> 41:40.900
set up here okay and that email is sent over that tls and chances are in new york now stock tls is due

41:40.900 --> 41:46.900
i can definitely see when i configure a new email account one of the options is pick start tls and

41:46.900 --> 41:52.900
sometimes your email provider if you don't pick it will not will refuse to work because they say no no no

41:52.900 --> 42:02.900
i want you to use start tls make sure the email is secure now the typical header fields in an email i can

42:02.900 --> 42:08.900
attach that you probably see are like these this is not there are more there could be a lot of extended maybe

42:08.900 --> 42:14.260
you see a lot of fields there called x dot dash have you seen if you look at the email remember

42:14.260 --> 42:20.900
the same thing feels like s dash that's extended optional fields but the required fields are these

42:20.900 --> 42:29.700
two to whom is this email this is one or more destinations carbon copy right who is copying on

42:29.700 --> 42:38.100
these emails and then blind carbon copy okay everyone knows what dcc is what's the stupidest thing anybody can

42:38.100 --> 42:49.460
have a doubt do with bcc have you ever received email by bcc i've never replied to an email by bcc

42:50.260 --> 42:51.540
that's the stupidest thing you can do

42:54.020 --> 43:00.900
does everybody see what i'm saying if you receive a mail by a bcc you use your address is in bcc that

43:00.900 --> 43:06.260
means everybody else does not see your email as one of the recipients you are a hidden recipient

43:08.020 --> 43:09.380
but if you do reply all

43:11.540 --> 43:17.300
everybody will see that yeah you got that email and you weren't on the address list

43:17.300 --> 43:26.180
you must have been bcc so don't do reply all if you're a bcc on email okay bcc then from who created

43:26.180 --> 43:31.300
this email the email address usually with a name sometimes with a name not always with a name right

43:33.380 --> 43:33.780
sender

43:36.180 --> 43:42.340
usually the same receive okay this is where you have one or more lines of the path

43:43.540 --> 43:49.460
right in this case just that is line added by each trip but it uses the word transfer agent but the

43:49.460 --> 43:57.300
sftp relay or server to show you the hops it went through return path right path back to the center

44:01.700 --> 44:05.220
let's look at this mail plain text

44:07.460 --> 44:15.780
received by received by so return path received received

44:15.780 --> 44:22.900
spf we'll talk about this message id from to subject

44:26.820 --> 44:30.260
okay you see the first receive gives you an ip address

44:32.980 --> 44:36.180
that was done 12 in a time stamp the second says

44:39.220 --> 44:43.540
received actually the same time stamp is possible because the time stamp is in seconds so

44:43.540 --> 44:50.260
uh it is quite possible pacific standard of time uh sftp id is a typically a

44:51.060 --> 44:56.020
hash of the message some kind of hash that can be assigned every email server can use its own

44:56.020 --> 45:02.260
heuristic to assign it but the ip addresses are supposed to be legitimate ip addresses

45:04.260 --> 45:06.820
return path some email address

45:06.820 --> 45:18.500
uh spf is called the center policy framework we'll talk about it it's basically a um

45:20.980 --> 45:28.740
this distinction between trusted and untrusted uh sources at the particle uh okay and then there is the

45:28.740 --> 45:36.500
person presumably who sent this email uh it generally should match return path you see return

45:36.500 --> 45:39.380
path path and and the front should match

45:41.860 --> 45:45.700
this is the destination so the victim here is this person

45:52.660 --> 45:59.300
so this stuff is inserted by relays all of that

45:59.300 --> 46:12.820
this one link pr is a isp in puerto rico okay

46:15.380 --> 46:21.700
it claims to have and you see what's there in a uh parenthesis in the brackets is an ip address

46:21.700 --> 46:26.340
it's supposed to correspond right so the one link pr.net is supposed to correspond to that address

46:27.060 --> 46:30.260
actually that is somewhere in mongolia

46:31.940 --> 46:35.540
how do you know if you ping right if you trace your output it's in mongolia

46:37.140 --> 46:41.780
so already we have that's the spam which means it's an artificially crafted

46:41.780 --> 46:44.340
uh message

46:48.820 --> 46:55.540
one in the game of bingo so why do spam spammers want to hide their sources

46:57.540 --> 47:01.140
right so there is this fundamental thing right when you get spam

47:02.980 --> 47:07.140
it obviously wants you to do something right if you fall for it it wants you to take an action

47:07.140 --> 47:16.180
like buy viagra or walk in bathtub or you know order some i don't know some crap on the internet

47:16.180 --> 47:22.980
right i mean it sends you somewhere right it's not a spam saying it's usually not like oh i don't know

47:22.980 --> 47:31.620
vote for uh candidate this you get the spam around election time right but um that's different so

47:31.620 --> 47:35.620
typically it wants you to do something so why if they want you to do something

47:36.340 --> 47:46.260
meaning go to some website or reply then why would they hide their sources you see the problem

47:50.500 --> 48:00.660
they hide their sources not so much from you the recipient but from your provider your isp and others who want to kill spam

48:00.660 --> 48:09.460
you see the distinction they don't really care so much that you know where it comes from they don't want

48:09.460 --> 48:13.380
others to know so they can't be blacklisted what was your question

48:13.380 --> 48:26.660
that's true that's true but typically you say you think right intuitively that oh you know it's the

48:27.380 --> 48:34.020
some even it's either that seller or the agent of the seller that's advertising this product right that

48:34.020 --> 48:40.100
that they're trying to get me to buy there should be a connection but that doesn't have to be right

48:40.100 --> 48:47.620
the seller for example could be in a place where they they you know in some other country

48:48.500 --> 48:54.420
and their email address might be filtered by policy like so what they do is they say you can

48:54.420 --> 49:00.740
contract the spammer in the united states they send the spammer a template i want you to

49:00.740 --> 49:11.060
to send to this 10 million addresses this type of message that says dear so and so i am god knows who

49:11.780 --> 49:20.580
a nigerian prince recently deceased with a lot of money to give away right but the idea is that okay

49:20.580 --> 49:25.460
if it comes from nigeria right if you see the head of nigeria it would be it would be thrown away but

49:25.460 --> 49:33.300
if it comes from the us source it won't be right if it's a us isp so that's the reason

49:35.220 --> 49:40.900
now of course spam filters they they do check the bodies of messages so you you you have these various

49:40.900 --> 49:46.260
like uh sophos and spam assassin and you might sometimes get from uci write these messages saying

49:46.260 --> 49:51.620
that we quarantine some messages right have you seen those you have to like to get them you have to

49:51.620 --> 49:57.940
clicks that go to some link and you know click that's true but spammers are really good at like

49:57.940 --> 50:04.340
evading them that's a whole separate subject right how do they evade spam filters because spam filters

50:04.340 --> 50:10.180
basically you know use some heuristics of ai but you know anything that they do can be circumvented if

50:10.180 --> 50:14.180
they know if you know the algorithms anyway

50:14.180 --> 50:23.700
there are these clearing houses i think they're still around spam houses spam spam cop dot net these

50:23.700 --> 50:30.420
are non-profits that you maintain giant data banks of uh spam addresses right there's spam providers

50:30.420 --> 50:38.820
spam relays um these and this is where your relays these are the typical databases that your mail relays

50:38.820 --> 50:43.860
will consult in you know as they try to deliver emails and so they will stop like between 15 and

50:43.860 --> 50:52.900
40 percent of spam but majority of spam still gets through okay uh the other problem is that by the

50:52.900 --> 50:57.540
time they check the bandwidth is already consumed right so the email can email consumes a lot of

50:57.540 --> 51:05.700
bandwidth as you can imagine especially if you have uh html inside email right or or some other markups

51:05.700 --> 51:12.020
right now you have s- does everybody know the s- is secure multimedia mail extension this is when you

51:12.020 --> 51:18.020
you receive email that is like signed or you know it has multiple parts and so on these these are giant

51:18.020 --> 51:24.500
or can be quite large uh messages not the typical text email that you get and so that if spammers use

51:24.500 --> 51:33.220
that it's very difficult um to prevent them from consuming bandwidth so for evading plot tests sorry for evading

51:33.220 --> 51:40.260
for evading for evading blacklists with blacklists typically don't say oh filter everything with the word

51:40.260 --> 51:51.540
viagra or anything with the word uh bathtub no they typically list uh ip addresses and host names of known spammers

51:51.540 --> 52:03.780
so one time trial and very effective trick that spammers use is called thin pipe thick pipe

52:05.860 --> 52:12.100
and it works like this so you have a target server let's say that serves uh let's say a particular company

52:12.100 --> 52:21.220
let's say uci ready right so this is our uh sftp server and the spammer wants to send a lot of spam to

52:21.220 --> 52:35.540
uci uh people like us okay so the spammer controls a botnet a botnet is full of zombies okay zombie botnet

52:37.060 --> 52:44.820
lsz stands for low speed zombie so this could be like one of your desktop computers in your lab or

52:44.820 --> 52:51.220
you know it could be a an old laptop that you have at home some would be even an iot device

52:53.780 --> 53:01.460
then the high speed bot is somewhere else this is geographically far away not near anywhere near the

53:01.460 --> 53:08.180
low speed zone low speed zombies are many there are thousands maybe tens and thousands of them so

53:08.180 --> 53:18.100
so the bot picks a zombie and says hey do a tcp handshake with that server right open smtp connection

53:22.020 --> 53:27.380
then pass on the tcp sequence numbers remember tcp sequence numbers offset

53:27.380 --> 53:42.900
to this high speed bar you might be getting where what i'm about to say bam send bulk mail with a source

53:43.620 --> 53:44.420
low speed zone

53:46.900 --> 53:53.860
remember ip addresses are not a form of authentication so so the high speed bot takes over the tcp session

53:53.860 --> 54:01.860
you see what's happening here this session was initiated by a low speed zombie as soon as the

54:01.860 --> 54:09.300
three-way tcp connection is established it passes on the sequence number to its big brother here

54:10.180 --> 54:16.660
the big brother says all right and sends a lot of spam over to the target server

54:17.460 --> 54:23.300
a target server thinks that this craft comes over on that connection you see

54:26.260 --> 54:28.580
cool what happens

54:32.100 --> 54:40.820
the high speed zombies ip address is hidden from the target server because what will happen

54:40.820 --> 54:49.060
okay remember how tcp works right it's all acknowledgement right data acknowledgement data

54:49.060 --> 54:56.100
acknowledgement and data can flow both ways but in email right in email what's happening is one relay

54:56.100 --> 55:02.660
has mailed message to send the other one is the receiver so the receiver does not send big data back

55:02.660 --> 55:11.700
right there's no messages to send back it's the sender that sends the message so the sender splits the

55:11.700 --> 55:16.740
message into chunks remember like tcp segments right because that should be long the email message can be

55:16.740 --> 55:22.900
long and it sends them with this via this tick line

55:22.900 --> 55:32.820
with the ip address of the low speed zombie now that that target victim server is going to do

55:32.820 --> 55:37.940
acknowledgments remember tcp acknowledgments they're not going to come on the thick pipe

55:39.780 --> 55:45.140
do you see why they cannot right because the acknowledgments will go to the ip address of the

55:45.140 --> 55:49.300
low speed zombie we don't assume that these guys are controlling internet routing

55:50.020 --> 55:55.940
so that this guy cannot force the tcp acknowledgments from this target server to come to it

55:57.060 --> 55:57.620
he cannot

55:59.940 --> 56:03.860
they will come here and that's okay they're in cahoots with each other

56:05.540 --> 56:05.780
so

56:08.980 --> 56:15.220
he's going to keep passing the offset now low bandwidth and this is a low bandwidth channel right low bandwidth

56:15.220 --> 56:23.780
the bulk of the data gets transmitted here it's a beautiful arrangement and it works now

56:23.780 --> 56:30.660
eventually the target the cdp server will say hey this is spam right somebody will mark it as spam

56:31.700 --> 56:36.740
and you'll say oh when did i receive it i received an ip address belonging to the low speed zombie

56:36.740 --> 56:45.540
okay let's left list the zombie done no more email from that a b address is accepted that's okay

56:48.740 --> 56:57.140
the high-speed bot goes on to the next zombie because he has thousands okay that other zombie that's done

56:57.140 --> 57:01.620
barrier that g you get the idea

57:05.380 --> 57:12.260
there are seven like amazing front-end tools for sending spam this is like one a bit old but it's an

57:12.260 --> 57:21.460
example this is a sensei program for windows it's a it's a spam automator you can configure it

57:21.460 --> 57:31.220
to send you see that it it from emails you can consider you can configure it to be like administrator

57:31.220 --> 57:43.140
at uciadu president usa.gov uh god at heaven dot earth whatever you want you can put it in the from

57:43.140 --> 57:50.580
uh you see the two aliases right this is to whom is this supposed to go webmaster administrator database

57:51.140 --> 57:58.660
okay you can vary all of these things subjects you see the subjects vary the subjects right hi hello

57:58.660 --> 58:04.340
how are you doing montano c etc okay and here's the actual middle text

58:06.500 --> 58:13.060
it's marked up dear black right so the name will go in there meaning the name two

58:14.020 --> 58:20.980
dear webmaster we'll go in there or or you see there's like a you don't want right here there's a

58:20.980 --> 58:28.180
or there is an or or dear colleague don't even need to like specifically address the person or

58:28.980 --> 58:37.220
hi account this is the typical way to identify when you see when you know it says hi john at uciadu

58:37.220 --> 58:48.820
have you ever received non-spam that says hi john at uciadu or or anything any greeting followed by your

58:48.820 --> 58:56.340
account name obviously that person does not know your name right so that's like a 99.99 indicator of

58:56.340 --> 59:02.180
spam when somebody refers to you by your account name but i guess people fall for it sometimes

59:03.060 --> 59:04.900
but it's a very nice automator

59:08.260 --> 59:14.900
all right uh if you're wondering where you know where the open proxies are that you can actually

59:14.900 --> 59:22.740
spend uh spam through well there's whole clearing houses of these of these proxies that you can what

59:22.740 --> 59:29.700
does it mean you can go there find a proxy that is alive and configure that proxy to be your outgoing

59:29.700 --> 59:36.260
smtp server so when you send email instead of going to google right or instead of going to uci

59:36.980 --> 59:44.500
uh smtp edu it will go to that open proxy okay so you can set this down through

59:46.980 --> 59:52.420
blacklisting turns out not to be enough because most ip addresses just like in a thin type

59:52.420 --> 59:56.340
thick type example with a low speed zombie most ip addresses send very little standards

59:57.220 --> 01:00:03.060
so blacklisting that's why is is very limited uh effectiveness because you blacklist something

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.420
and it will never spend some time again anyway by the time you blacklist it it's too late

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:14.820
right what does it show you it's a fraction of clients that says crap in number of appearances

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.060
it means most of them said like once and then they go away

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:29.700
okay because they're disposable where they come from well this is a while ago okay this is uh this

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:35.300
is a this is a this is a while ago but at the time this is like almost 20 years ago these were i

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:42.980
see the as number these are the organizations where spam originally it doesn't mean they spend spam it means

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.420
their clients sent spam

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.900
the the picture would be very different today i already said that

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:10.980
ah this was around 2010 2012 the world was ruled by uh what like half a thousand giant spam bots

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:21.940
yeah that was the world back then two particular had the lion's share swisbee and rostock they dominated

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:28.980
the world of spam they were not themselves creators of spam they were the engines of spam do you see what i'm

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:37.060
saying they were sending spam they were not creating it they were taking it from their clients and amplifying it

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:46.900
most of them used a provider in northern california nisp

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:55.700
okay that was uh very happy making money on them right uh it was not a bot but it had all these

01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:02.020
clients right it hosted these command and control servers command and control server is the brain of a bot

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:11.540
right as the word name suggests command and control and so both rostock and frisbee were hosted right

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:17.940
there by this isp now you all know what the difference between hosting provider and isp

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:24.180
there's very they're similar but not the same you know the difference what's the difference what's the

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:30.660
difference what's the difference between a hosting provider and isp uh a hosting provider is like

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:36.020
so an isp provides the internet service and that's it pretty much yeah

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:43.860
a hosting a hosting doesn't provide internet service it provides like yeah it usually does i mean

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:51.460
yes true technically no usually does but but its primary purpose is to let you put your stuff on there

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:58.340
exactly so you can put your web server yeah on a hosting provider okay a world world press is a

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:03.860
hosting provider right like that google is a hosting provider uh but uh you're also tiny

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:10.820
this was a relatively small one but it hosted all this now when it was disconnected imagine this three

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:18.980
quarters of the spam in the world disappeared overnight that was incredible i remember it because uh

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.780
all of a sudden i heard of it like two days later i realized i used to receive a lot of spam i went

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:33.780
to my phone for the first time in 10 years there was no spam um now swisbee was it was an interesting

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:39.860
character it was a rookie and a mailer right so basically it was a combination of malware and spam

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:46.100
in order to have a a botnet you need to have zombies and you have zombies you must have malware they

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:51.380
created those zombies and zombified them so there's always malware involved in creating a botnet

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:55.220
it was at one point responsible for more than half the spam worldwide

01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:01.620
and when the mid-color uh hosting provider was taken down the zombies did not disappear right they

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:08.100
still lived it's like you decapitate the head of the snake but the rest of it is still moving

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:16.340
so the zombies were motherless all of a sudden right the mother ship has gone away but whoever created

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:23.060
that botnet was pretty smart and they wanted to essentially for the zombies to look for a different

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:28.820
mother or a different command and control center and they were programmed to do so and they started

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:34.740
generating backup domains like this like weird looking backup domains and trying to connect to them

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:43.460
thinking where's my mother where's my mother right and sure enough the people who were behind this

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:51.220
botnet created for you know regain control of the zombies by creating a backup mother uh not surprising

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:56.340
through a registrar registrar is the assigned name authority that uh assigns domain names in a given

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:03.460
country every country has one well they did it for a russian registrar and hosted new commanding control

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:10.260
service in estonia so all of a sudden that was like a phoenix from ashes the zombies like in a

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:16.580
movie they arose and found themselves a mother a new mother it was then disconnected and shut down but

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:24.260
it was an interesting state rust talk no no no okay we're right all right i just want to well the rest of

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:30.740
it i guess we'll see either we'll cover it next time or if i decide to switch to a different topic then

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:36.340
you'll just read it on your own the thing i want to point out is there are legal ways of uh encountering

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:44.420
spam there's a can spam act that u.s uh uh federal government was passed by the congress in 2003 there

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:49.620
is something called spf which i mentioned earlier that is a technical way of fighting spam and there

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:55.780
is something called the main themes maybe we'll talk about it a little bit next time all right any questions

01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:05.540
before we go yes in practice uh if you're like a user of say gmail and someone else is using gmail would

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:12.420
they would gmail actually use the smtp protocol or would they just like use standard you know in the

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:19.220
google universe you don't even need smtp protocol unless you're using an app so from your app to google

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:27.700
google is smtp with a 587 right what he said and after that there's probably no really right it's

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:32.260
totally internal to google it's like you know if you have hotmail account it's the same you're sending

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:38.740
to another hotmail very very very similar yeah now when you start crossing domains right what he's saying

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:45.460
from gmail to hotmail then you are you're going to have this relay to relay okay okay so other than

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:51.700
uh sample final anything else okay see you thursday

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:06.900
hey uh did you say uh the final date is it on 10. sorry the final exam date did you say anything

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:17.540
uh it declared in canvas yes yes okay you can see it from the uh
